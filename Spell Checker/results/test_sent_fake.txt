the product does exactly as it should and is quite affordable.i did not realized it was double screened until it arrived , so it was even better than i had expected.as an added bonus , one of the screens carries a small hint of the smell of an old grape candy i used to buy , so for reminiscent 's sake , i can not stop putting the pop filter next to my nose and smelling it after recording . 
: dif you needed a pop filter , this will work just as well as the expensive ones , and it may even come with a pleasing aroma like mine did!buy this product ! 
:] nice windscreen protects my mxl mic and prevents pops . 
only thing is that the gooseneck is only marginally able to hold the screen in position and requires careful positioning of the clamp to avoid sagging . 
perfect for my epiphone sheraton ii . 
monster cables are well constructed . 
i have several and never had any problems with any of them over the years . 
got this one because i wanted the 90 degree plug . 
monster makes the best cables and a lifetime warranty doesnt hurt either . 
this isnt their top of the line series but it works great with my bass guitar rig and has for some time . 
you cant go wrong with monster cables . 
i love it , i used this for my yamaha ypt-230 and it works great , i would recommend it to anyone i bought this to use in my home studio to control my midi keyboard . 
it does just what i wanted it to do . 
wanted it just on looks alone ... it is a nice looking cord ... i know it will perform ... as for sam ash ... this cord was packed in a mailer inside another box with my roc n soc ... his shipping team do great work . . 
never any complaints from me ... i love sam ash . . 
thanks amazon use it every week at gigs . 
solid , no problems with the solder joints . 
a good quality cable at a very good price . 
good quality cable and sounds very good i bought this because i wanted a cheap replacement cable for one that had a short . 
i 'm pleasantly surprised with this cable . 
it 's decent sound and decent build quality , for a good price . 
seems sturdy enough , and no noise issues , so i 'm pretty much satified with it ; it does n't leave the house so i 'm not asking it to handle a lot , but with reasonable care it should last a while . 
bought this for my daughter along with her new guitar . 
it seems to work well , no issues in the first couple of weeks . 
pretty crappy cable . 
it works and gets the job done , but after purchasing this product and using it , i will shell out the extra bucks for better quality . 
this product does exactly what it is supposed to do at a decent price . 
i have absolutely no complaints . 
this is my first experience with the brand and i am not disappointed . 
this guitar cable is very nice . 
it looks high quality and has the white ends . 
fantastic deal for this cable . 
good product at a good price . 
have used it multiple times and works well with my guitar and speaker . 
great to have when friends come over to jam . 
these are good cables at a good price !! 
not sure they would hold up to heavy use , but for practicing at home they are really great ! 
unless you 're going to go for the very top of the line most expensive professional chords , these will do for any medium sized venue . 
the cable is great for connecting directly to the computer microphone to record live without a console or mixer ... . 
its great i recomended if you 're like me , you probably bought this to hook up an xlr microphone to a digital recorder or a pc.it works fine for the handy type recorders.but forget hooking this directly to a pc . 
way too much noise . 
on my mixer , i have send/returns on the same plug using a 3 wire trs with send on the tip , return on the ring , and a common ground . 
but my effects boxes like to have separate 1/4 '' tr ins and outs.this is the perfect cable for just such a hookup of things like the behringer sharkbehringer shark fbq100 automatic feedback destroyerto the 1202-vlz3 's send/returnsmackie 1202-vlz3 12-ch . 
compact recording/sr mixeri probably will order a second cable having seen how well the first one worked out on a send/return . 
i play my i-pod through a small guitar amp . 
great way to wake up the kids . 
works perfectly for the purpose . 
keep in mind small end for i-pod is stereo and large end that goes into amp in mono . 
if needing a stereo jack at both ends get something else . 
picked up a cable to test on my new pedalboard , and i could n't be happier . 
does n't suck tone , cables are sturdy , and they sound great . 
this replaced a normal straight 1/4 inch cable and saves so much space on my board . 
these are great cables . 
the only con i could give is if they go bad ... no opening up the ends to fix them , but in my experience they are durable . 
most people are using these on a pedal board so there 's not a lot of movement to wear them down . 
really just some inexpensive and yet durable cables to link your stompboxes together . 
as of yet , i havent had one go all crackly , which , considering they get frequent use , is pretty good . 
often , cheap cords die within a year or so . 
every electric guitarist keeps a stock of these things , and this one in particular is cheap and accessible . 
i probably have around twelve of them.enjoy ! 
i got 3 of these to plug xlr cables into the 1/4 &#34; jacks on my board . 
i got it because my board only has 6 channels with xlr inputs . 
none of them work . 
perhaps i got the wrong thing ? 
what was it , brillcream ? 
a dab will do ya?something like that - this is all you need for contact cleaning . 
worth the coin . 
i used this on my guitar tone and volume pots and it clears up the crackle.feels a little oily , but gets the job done and you do n't have to replacethe potentiometers . 
we bought this mic and a spare for our son 's guitar amp set-up for his mixer . 
it seems to work fine , and comes with the mic cord , we decided to go for the model with the on = off switch based on other reviews , and have n't yet been disappointed . 
these cables are a little thin compared to hosa and gls . 
they picked up a little interference from other equipment as well . 
guessing they are lacking some shielding . 
i use this for video exchanges on a guitar instruction website . 
it 's perfect for vocals , podcasting , video recording and so forth . 
shure makes excellent stuff . 
what 's also great is you save some money as an xlr cable is included . 
i 'm very happy with this purchase . 
4 stars instead of 5 only because this thing wo n't tune your guitar or carry your amp . 
i use this solo , in a duo with a bass player , in a trio with drums and bass . 
i have a regular gig at a medium sized club that is basically one large room . 
i use it through a pyle pro self contained pa into which i also plug my martin grp elec/acoustic . 
the sound quality is excellent . 
the volume seems limited only bny what the pyle pro will put out . 
i would have no hesitation using this for bigger rooms with a full band and pa. . 
i have n't heard a hint of feedback and the on/off switch is a plus.the 36.99 price might seem to good to be true but think of the things for which we are paying less for than we used to . 
i bought a 32 &#34; toshiba flat screen for around 230 bucks , think of what that would have cost even five years ago or less . 
the same is true of a lot of audio gear . 
a lot of companies are bringing high quality elctronics and music to the market but it 's great to have a company like shure make something so good and so affordable . 
they have always made a high quality product and now they have one that almost anyone can afford . 
i can not recommend it strongly enough . 
this microphone is great for singing with a pa and an electric guitar . 
i sing worship/praise songs and southern gospel and it is very smooth in the mid range and when you get up close it enhances the bass nicely . 
i do n't think it is the same as an sm58 but it is exactly what i need . 
built to last and it is a shure . 
good mic for simple live stuff that is n't too expensive . 
it gets a good clear sound and has an on off switch that helps with all kinds of things this mic is well made -lrb- heavy on the mic-end -rrb- . 
however , i have yet to try it with my multi-track studio . 
i bought this for my teen son for christmas . 
he loves to play his bass and sing along . 
he had a different shure mic and it was totally flat compared to this particular model . 
nice and clean sounds , plus it seems pretty sturdy . 
we did get him a mic stand and it fits on it perfectly and stays put . 
shure knocked this one out of the park . 
these are my preferred mics for practice and gigs ... an all around tough mic ... great for all your needs ... i highly recommend them . . 
it is not a bad mic for the price -lrb- if you want a real good one with studio quality mic it would cost over 600 bucks -rrb- but it is no comparison to a studio mic since i have worked in a recording studio . 
now , you need to decide what you want , getting a studio mic alone does not give you the result you are looking for ; it is like having hd tv and bd player but playing an ordinary cd . 
you would have to compliment the mic with many other products like a studio quality mixer , speakers and so on . 
if you are a home or hobby user , then go for this mic . 
this mic is quite good for its price . 
i would probably say , it exceeds your expectations.arrived as promised in a frustration free packing . 
also , make sure you buy a foam mic hood for the mic to save it from unwanted dirt and spit.the only reason i did not give 5 stars is , mine had a little dent on the body -lrb- may be due to transportation -rrb- but it has nothing to do with the function but just the looks . 
received it in time , standard blister packaging but the cable stopped working after 45 days . 
since i was out of 30 days return time , sent an email to the manufacturer but no response till today . 
these things are terrible . 
one would n't fit in my soundboard , another would n't lock in my mic . 
plain and simple ... if your looking for crap that does n't work ... buy this . 
well made and the perfect length for my needs . 
the shielding was great as well . 
the end connectors were well made and strong . 
like most products on the market , depending on where and how the item is used , your experience may vary . 
for me , this cable is going to be used on a semi-stationary mic stand in my project studio , and thus far , it 's done nothing but an exceptional job . 
i tested the cable with a few different mics and in each scenario , the signal was just as strong as the some of the other , more pricey cables out there . 
would i purchase this again ? 
absolutely ! 
they are screws . 
they screw in and hold things . 
to say that they did less would 've gotten the 1 star . 
i like them . 
great rack mount screws . 
rubber washers are perfect , lets it give your item that tight fit without worry of the screws working out any time soon . 
i use them on my portable desktop rack with my mobile dj equipment and they have held strong . 
there are other rack screws out there , but raxxess makes the best quality screws and soft washers available . 
mics are like pants , you have to find the right fit . 
this one i like for my vocals live . 
i sing fairly low and airy - works great for me . 
also used to mic resonator guitar through a tube mic preamp live , very sweet sound . 
i prefer it to the 58 , seems a bit more bright and natural . 
might purchase another one eventually ... i 'm an amateur sound tech . 
we 've been using sm58 in our church for years now and our singers/song leaders liked it very much than the other mics that we 've had before . 
our singers are growing and we needed addtional mic so we thought of this beta58a because of the good reviews . 
when i received it i can not wait to test it myself and whoaaah . . 
for me , it sounded better than sm58 . 
my songleaders have tested it and guess what ... they dont want to use the sm58 anymore :-rrb- the beta 58a along with the original sm58 are industry standards , that 's well known . 
as a general purpose workhorse for live vocals they are by far the most popular tools out there . 
quality venues throughout the country commonly stock these as their go-to house mics . 
in fact , i noticed betas all over the place at a small theater -lrb- with a high-end system -rrb- that i played at just recently.i had used the old 58 for years before moving to the beta and there is certainly a noticeable difference between the two . 
the beta is definitetly hotter , with a more sensitive response . 
your vocals will cut into the mix strongly and with more clarity than you might be used to . 
mids and highs are picked up perfectly when singing a few inches away and there is a subtle low frequency roll-off to avoid that boomy , muddled sound you typically get when hitting low or quiet notes up close . 
you definitely need to stay within a close range though as the pickup pattern is very tight . 
this is a good thing because extraneous noise and feedback is effectively rejected . 
`` built like a tank '' is probably a bit overused when describing products but shure 's vocal mics truly earn that title . 
they can take an enormous amount of abuse and never falter . 
toss it around , drop it , bury it under other stuff , etc. , no problem . 
when you are maintaining a bunch of music gear , it 's nice to have tools that you never worry about . 
for that reason , i 'd highly recommend getting a used one if you can find a deal . 
chances are , its in working order no matter what . 
it sounds great . 
nice and warm and lush . 
one of the better trems i 've had the pleasure to use . 
however , i hate the plastic housing , and how the input/output jacks are located . 
i do n't have heavy feet , so it will probably last a good long while on my board , but i really would n't want to put too much weight on it . 
love these capos and nice that you can get them in other colours . 
prevents you from getting yours confused with some one elses . 
purchased the 6-string kyser capo when i meant to get the 12-string version -lrb- slightly longer , stronger spring ? -rrb- 
, but find that this 6-string capo not only works great on my 2 6-string acoustics , but also works on my 12-string acoustic with a little adjusting . 
quality seems top notch , design is simple and effective . 
i 've owned the same one for 10 years and it 's still going strong after many gigs . 
the spring tension is just right . 
it is very well made , is easy to use , and holds down the strings just fine . 
it is well protected as to not scratch or nick your guitar . 
i started using kyser capos a couple of years ago and have never looked back since . 
i now own several of them and have not had any problems with any of them . 
they work great on acoustic and electric guitars and they have survived the many children i teach lessons to even though they get treated rather rough at times . 
great capos . 
you wo n't be disappointed . 
i originally bought this for my guitar and it worked very well for that , so i tried it out on my 4 string uke and it works just as great . 
it 's so much better than the elastic capos . 
so , it 's doing double duty and going strong . 
my husband usese this capo almost everytine he plays his guitar . 
his old one lasted about 10 years . 
worth the cost . 
i got pink cause nobody would steal it , and we all know how often capos get stolen from people pink is great these martin strings -lrb- m170 -rrb- are n't bad . 
they just are not the sound i was looking for . 
i ended up like the ernie ball earthwood extra light instead . 
the martin 's are little shallow on the low end unlike the ernie ball . 
other people will love them though . 
they are easy to play . 
i ordered a couple sets of this strings so i would have some extras for myself and my 6 year old son who is just starting out on guitar . 
this strings have good sound and hold a tune well . 
the best thing is the price is great . 
like i said i am usinging these on mine and my sons guitar and my son was breaking string from playing to hard , but with these string it does not break the bank to replace them as needed . 
these strings provide a warm crisp tone that makes any dreadnought guitar sound like heaven i use them all the time good strings with good sound.the extra light is easier on the fingers - but they sound thinner too.go for the light gauges for more solid sound if you can handle the pressure . 
i bought this pick holder because i hate putting a pick between my strings to hold it and because you ca n't play with a pick in your strings . 
i originally thought this thing would be kind of large and go all the way across the headstock . 
boy was i wrong . 
the picture is misleading . 
this thing is tiny and barely goes across three string . 
it wedges under neath two strings and you can put two picks -lrb- maybe more if they are thin -rrb- into the wedges on top . 
stays in place well and is very convenient.only negative is i do n't know how long it will hold up . 
i think maybe a thicker rubber rather than this foam rubber would have held up better . 
i can see this thing eventually losing tension in the pick holder wedges and dropping picks . 
i love the idea that you do n't need a pocket in your strap or elsewhere to store your pick . 
further it will not add something else to find/loose in my pants pocket . 
not too much to say , it 's made out of foam , made to slip between the strings , made to hold two picks . 
i have several of these , for acoustics and for electrics . 
my son lost one before during a performance on stage so it is not that secure that it wo n't be dislodged , still , it does stay on majority of the time . 
i do recommend this . 
my son 's guitar teacher calls this a `` fancy little pick holder '' and i 've had people ask where to buy one when they see it for the first time . 
one must also be careful , my son lost one of these so i know it is a possibility of it falling off . 
he lost it after performing in a play on stage.please click yes if my review have been helpful to you , it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews , and leave a comment if you have any questions , i will be more than happy to answer if i can be of help . 
i bought one of these to try on my asher junior lap steel guitar to hold two finger picks and a thumb pick . 
worked , but it was difficult getting all three picks in one wedgie so i ordered a second one . 
between the two of them , between the 2nd/3rd and 4th/5th strings up next to the nut , works pretty good holding these types of picks -lrb- which admittedly , the wedgie was not actually designed for -rrb- . 
liked it so much i ordered two more for my acoustic and electric guitar and one for my bass -lrb- the bass version -rrb- . 
only down side i see is -- they do seem loose like they could fall out and i doubt the picks will stay in place when i case my guitar -lrb- have n't tried it yet -rrb- . 
but otherwise , worth the price and a good doo-dad to have around . 
especially if you have a lap steel and need a place to stick your finger picks on the guitar itself -lrb- real help to me staying organized ! -rrb- . 
exactly the same as describe here , love the sound and easy to play . 
great price for excellent sound , highly recommend to everyone . 
this is one awesome guitar ! 
i also purchased the fender mustang i amp , epiphone custom case -lrb- fits like a glove -rrb- and planet waves planet lock leather guitar strap -lrb- comfortable and very secure -rrb- which made for an unbelieveable combination along with rocksmith 2014 . 
i can not imagine anyone being disappointed with this combination . 
the only problem in my household is ... who gets to play next . 
i am editing my previous review on this little guitar after taking the time to properly set it up , dial it in and play it for a while . 
i edited yet again as someone did n't appreciate my `` gloating '' over other guitars i own . 
sorry to offend you.i made a knee jerk review -lrb- again -rrb- right after i got this . 
but in all fairness i received my gibson les paul on the same day , buying it from my local music store and professionally set up , ready to go . 
i was comparing apples and oranges , so to speak . 
but now , even after comparing them to each other , they really are n't that far apart.the gibson is the best guitar i 've ever owned and made my previous comparison based on it . 
but this little baby is now my second favorite.my other review was not fair !!!!!! i paid a lot more for the gibson and 149 bucks for this epiphone . 
dollar for dollar this little ephiphone is a steal !!!! wow !!! 
i must honestly admit , the edge goes to my gibson , but not by as much as you 'd think . 
this little epiphone is an outstanding guitar , regardless of price . 
if i were to play them each blindfolded i would never guess one was $ 149 guitar , ever ! 
the tone of the epiphone is much like the gibson les paul . 
it 's easy to play , comfortable and has a sweet sound . 
i can either rock out with it or mellow out and play the blues or classic rock.to be honest , i will probably play this epiphone a lot more than the gibson . 
after all , if i ding this one up i have n't broke the bank . 
i think i 'll tend to use this one a lot more than the other.i am very happy with this epiphone les paul and will proudly play and own it . 
i am amazed they can make this thing for the money they charge . 
i may purchase another one and put it away as i 'm sure the price wo n't stay this low . 
plus , i 'll get another one in a different color !! 
you can never have too many guitars . . 
i am going to an a pickguard to this one . 
the finish on it is outstanding and i 'd like to keep it that way.if i were thinking of learning to play the guitar , this one is a no-brainer ... buy it !!! 
if you 're an established player looking for a really nice practice guitar , i 'd buy this one is a heartbeat . 
i was shocked at how sweet it sounds , how good it looks , how comfortable and light it is and how well it plays . 
sure it was way out of tune and required a few height adjustments but now it is fantastic.new rule for me , no writing reviews until i own the product for at least one week !!!!! good overall but pick ups are terrible - might be better replacing the pickups but i was n't willing to spend the extra money i got this pretty fast . 
i took it out of the box and wanted nothing more than to give it 5 stars just for value alone . 
i 'm still shaking my head in disbelief that i got this guitar for the price . 
first , the ` tuner ' issues that i 've been reading about . 
replace the strings ! 
i stretched and stretched these things and they would not stay in tune . 
a set of d'addario 10 's cured that straight away -lrb- or whatever you prefer just change them -rrb- . 
the tuners are n't the best but they are not to blame , it 's the cheap strings . 
now , technically if you only play open chords this was playable out of the box . 
the neck angle was so off the a string rattled no matter how high i set the bridge . 
the guitar would not intonate due to the ridiculous angle . 
yes i could have sent it back but i suspect i would have gotten another just like it . 
i had to spend about 6 hours shimming the neck and the nut -lrb- never had to do this to the nut on an electric , not even on a used guitar . 
the nut slot was cut too deep -rrb- , as well as working on leveling nearly every fret to make it playable . 
it required 3 business cards to shim the neck which is the most i 've ever had to use . 
after i got that straight i removed a bit of paint from the neck and set it with wood glue in the pocket and on all the screws . 
in my opinion this helps a great deal with these and all bolt ons for that matter.if i bought this used none of this would have been a big deal . 
but as i 'm looking at this horrid neck angle and doing all this work i 'm steadily staring at the ` qc passed ' sticker . 
must have been built on a friday afternoon or something . 
-- now -- after i did this it is sweet !! . 
i play through a peavey valveking 100 and it rocks as good as my strat w / duncans and dimarzios . 
the quality of the electronics is not sub par at all . 
after adjusting the pickups screws to match the string height and getting all the horrible wax off them , i 'd argue that this is as good as any epi i 've ever played as far as pups and all , so do n't hesitate there because i do n't really care for epis and i 'm in love with it . 
-lrb- i bought this to sell mainly , but now ???? -rrb- the build quality ; hmm , if you can do guitar work go for it . 
otherwise i 'd highly recommend a more expensive model . 
the $ 299 models are great right out of the box usually . 
i got one of these a while back and being like i am with guitars took it apart to see just what it 's made of.mahogany ply maybe or capped with real , but it 's plywood body inside.kinda shocked in competitive guitar market that epi would go there ... otherwise decent build , basic original lp design bolt on , surprisingly good electronics w / full size pots and open back 3 way toggle , good neck but bad tuners ... . 
note : any 45 % mount tuners , meaning mount hole at 8 and 4 o'clock position respectively ... will fit with the bottom hole of the 2 screw junk tuners mine had . 
so add 10 $ to get more than 30 minute in tune play here.and you can fill the other little holes with nail polish like it was made right to begin with.i like the style , and though there 's plywood involved still good fit and finish , though many disagree it makes no real difference what electric guitar body woods are , only in looks . 
electric guitars do n't resonate , that 's why pickups are important.i do n't like the idea of this as beginners choice for the simple fact of cheap tuning keys.you lose interest learning on something that ca n't hold good tuning . 
so that bugs me that big player choice like epi would do that.it 's likely they 'll keep this style but revise it some ... to be hardwood body and real tuners as i think the price point demands it . 
otherwise a decent piece good wiring , decent pickups ... but ... my axesepiphone lp studio deluxe plustopfender maraudertakamine g320squier standard stratsquier standard pj bassbeen playing 20 years.i had a squier bullet and it was a cheap guitar i did n't care about that i could keep next to the couch to play rocksmith with . 
but it got old and i wore the frets out so i needed a new cheap guitar for rocksmith . 
i picked up the lp special 2 in black at guitar center for $ 130 and they kicked in free strings.bought it for a game , but soon found myself using it more than my other guitars because it sounded so good , played so well , and had a killer tone.my lp studio had it 's pickups replaced with the zakk wylde 81/85 's which made for good metal but it lost some of that bluesy tone that passives have . 
imagine my delight when my inexpensive epiphone had great sustain , tone , and playability . 
considering this thing is almost the same prices a bullet squier , it is easily twice the guitar for that price . 
you literally can not find a better guitar for $ 150 than the special 2 ... sound : 5/5two passive humbuckers have a great sound with glossy highs , deep lows , and they put just the right amount of dirt on a tone for a gutsy clean or distorted sound.the pickups were wax dipped and did not have the microphone feedback effect.the pickups are high output and feel like alnico more than ceramic . 
not sure which they have.so much sustain for a bolt on neck . 
i was shocked.build quality 4/5i did have 1 problem with the high e tuner . 
i did n't notice in the store but the string peg was 1/4 '' up out of the headstock . 
when i discovered this i loosened the string , whacked it with my fret hammer and it popped right in and stayed that way.intonation required no adjustment.action was exactly the way i like itneck was straight with no fret buzz or excessive bow.the finish was perfect . 
no nicks , blemishes , just oily black goodness.neck was flush with no gaps or seams , and professionally shimmed . 
damn good for a bolt on.hardware is typical for the price but does the job , stays in tune very well.back bending headstock and 3x3 orientation mean no string trees which makes tuning much more stable.the bridge is similar to my lp studio with the tunamatic setup . 
individual strings may be intonated but action is done with two nuts , ie can raise one side higher or lower but not individual strings.weird having the toggle between the volume knobs but i soon got used to it . 
no pickguard and it does n't need one . 
lots of relief between strings and body . 
you wo n't find yourself hitting the pickup housings or body with the pick . 
makes it easy to clean too!truss rod is behind a nice body color plate.frets were smooth , rounded , and played nice . 
could use a little buffing for silky smooth but not rough.neck plays fast but the nut took some getting used to . 
i would catch it on my hand when fretting at the top , soon got used to it and it was n't an issue .500 k pots and side body 1/4 trplug keeps the cable out of the way.overall 5/5came with hex keys for setupcame with an awsome poster with all the epiphone guitar modelscame with a nice bumper stickerno manualbody was packed in foam shroud with foam blocks , about the same as any other $ 150 guitar.summary : this guitar is the best bang for the buck of any instrument i own . 
it sounds good enough to gig with out of the box . 
it 's well built , plays well , and if you treat it well it should give you years of great music . 
the frets are medium jumbo 's and a little deeper than a fender meaning they should last longer before needing re-fretting than a typical affinity or bullet -lrb- 2 squiers in this price range -rrb- . 
i would say this guitar is suitable for all styles of music . 
i did blues , metal , country , and pop . 
the pickups are humbuckers which means they are darker and higher output than a fender , not as much of those nice fender bell like tones and chime but it makes up for it with power and clarity.one thing i like about epiphones and gibsons is the volume pot is not close to the bridge . 
this makes it very easy to palm mute and play with high gain . 
i lay my pinky and the knife edge of my hand lightly across the strings right where they hit the bridge and it makes a nice mute but on my strats the damn volume knob is in the way.as an experiment i took the pick up pole scews out of the bottom pickup to see if i could get a single coil sound out of it . 
what happened was a mess because of the parafin wax which got everywhere . 
the tone was a little brighter and output a little lower , still no hum but you would n't fool anyone into thinking it was a single coil . 
i ended up putting the screws back in.i will likely put my lp studio stock pickups back in -lrb- hell yeah coil tapping here i come ! -rrb- 
and move my emg 81/85 's in this lp special 2 and make myself a nice little metal guitar.do yourself a favor , buy this guitar even if you already have a better guitar . 
it 's cheap enough that you wo n't care if you bang it around a little , and good enough that you will enjoy playing it for many years . 
wow , you would have thought this was the holy grail when it arrived at my house . 
my son practically ran to the ups man when the truck pulled up . 
he is thrilled with this guitar . 
great purchase . 
a friend showed up at our monthly guitar club meeting with this and i loved having an on/off switch right at my fingertips . 
genius!i bought 2 immediately . 
the shorter one goes from my guitar to the pedal board and the longer one from the pedal board to the amp . 
works like a charm and no excuse now for damaging amps or ears.two issues to consider . 
the right angle plug was a mm or 2 short of being able to stick into my tele and my takamine . 
it would not seat properly and would slide out . 
i had to turn the cord around and use the right angle on the pedal board side , where it worked , but now the switch is &#34; down there &#34; . 
i do n't think planet waves is the first connector that i had a problem with that so i dont blame them , but maybe stick with the straight jack if you are not sure . 
second issue is simply that these little button-switches are fussy . 
you have to make sure you have it in the right position by looking at them - feel wont do . 
-lrb- if you see the white edge they are &#34; quiet &#34; -rrb- so far i am a very satisfied customer with this cable . 
for what is worth , while i have used these cables before , this is the first one i have ever owned , so i am no expert . 
update : the right angle switched end started developing crackling issues and is now intermittently cutting out . 
i 've had it just over a month , so amazon wo n't help me . 
despite the lifetime warranty , amazon has only offered to let me pay shipping and to give me a partial refund . 
despite being an `` authorized retailer '' for planet waves , amazon does not offer exchange under the planet waves warranty beyond the standard amazon 30 day return policy . 
amazon support referred me to the manufacturer . 
i 've emailed planet waves , but the instructions for the warranty are to return it to a dealer for exchange . 
i do n't have a dealer within 100 miles of my home , so unless the manufacturer comes through , this one is quickly becoming unusable and it looks like it might cost me to resolve it.i frequently switch instruments and this makes it easy to do quietly . 
i 've used cables with the g&h ; quiet plug -lrb- which also works well -rrb- , but the switched connector on this has an advantage over the g&h - ; you can use it as a mute and tune with a head stock tuner without unplugging your instrument . 
the cable itself is a bit stiffer than i 'm used to , which makes coiling for storage very easy , but it can quickly become a twisted mess on stage if you more length than you really need . 
the little elastic cord keeper strap works better than i could ever have imagined . 
i 've never given the sound of a cable a thought , being a bass player who does n't use much for effects and who plays mostly passive instruments . 
but using this with my genz benz shuttlemax 9.2 and fearful 15/6/1 cab , i really notice a pronounced difference in clarity and dynamics . 
the sound is much more alive with this over any of the other cables i have from a variety of manufacturers -lrb- hosa , proco , whirlwind , etc -rrb- . 
i 've never had to warranty exchange a pw cable , but others tout the easy swap at any pw dealer as a great reason to buy them . 
i like knowing that . 
** edit : as stated above , you will not be able to exchange it through amazon beyond 30 days ** man this is perfect ! 
some people says that the cs3 is noisy but i thinks that depends on what type of electric conections you got at home or place you play , if you do n't have a independent circuit for your pedalboard there 's gon na be a lot of noise , most of all bcuz of the compression -lrb- obviously -rrb- ... for me this is perfect , does n't make any noise with my conections ... tottally recommend this ! 
it really pains me to give anything but a 5-star review to a boss product , since i 'm such a big fan of their product line and build quality overall . 
those compliments apply equally to the cs-3 compression sustainer . 
and it does do the job reasonably well without me having to worry about putting a less-reliable brand in my signal chain.however , there are some minor issues with this pedal that you need to know . 
the two most common complaints that i see are that it adds `` noise '' to your amp and that it changes the tone a bit . 
the former complaint is probably true , though if you 're enough of a hobbyist to use a compression sustainer , you 're probably already contemplated using a noise gate/suppressor , such as the boss ns-2 . 
problem solved.as for the latter complaint -lrb- changes tone -rrb- , that 's also true , but it 's not necessarily a bad thing if you like the tone that results . 
the whole point of the cs-3 is that it 's supposed to cut out the extremes of your tone and sustain it . 
this can result in a muddy , `` neutered '' tone , though you can play with the tone and other settings to help it . 
i also find that with the settings all at 12 o'clock , the output is too quiet compared to other pedals at default settings.really , while boss pedals are considered to be `` expensive '' compared to many of the other effects out there , the cs-3 should really be viewed as a `` budget '' or `` entry level '' compressor , when you consider that most of the quality compressors are either in rack units or something like a keeley compressor costing north of $ 200 . 
the best thing you can say about the boss -lrb- even compared to the similarly-priced mxr options -rrb- is that the cs-3 gives you a great deal of control over your compression for a reasonable price . 
the biggest negative of the pedal , in my opinion , is that the resulting sound might seem a little too ... compressed.but there are a lot of things you could do with a cs-3 , and it works best paired with other pedals -lrb- chorus , delay , some distortions -rrb- that you 're trying to smooth out . 
ultimately , it 's a pedal that could have been better , though there are n't too many significantly better alternatives until you get north of $ 100 anyway . 
i have had this pedal for about 15 years , just replaced the old one a month ago . 
it distorts sound , not quite the way you would imagine though . 
this affect sounds really good through a fat cab or a larger amp that can let the cabinet give the tone a little color . 
i use it through a epiphone valve jr and a marshall 2x12 stack with jtm45 on top and its fine . 
this thing through a champ or smaller amp will not give you the meat you are probably looking for without a eq pedal.this does just what it says it does . 
one volume knob , one tone , and one distortion knob . 
crank it . 
this pedal is a must have for any pedal board . 
i love the overdriven sound of this pedal in that it has a distortion element but not so distorted single notes are lost in the fray . 
thirty some odd years and counting and still one of the best . 
this was the first pedal i ever bought when i started playing guitar 15 years ago . 
it 's still in my primary set up ! 
the sound it puts out is very balanced : you can get a subtle overdrive-like sound out of it , or a high-gain hard rock/80 's metal sound out of it . 
for those looking for insane crunch , this is n't for you . 
anyone that wants a nice , versatile pedal , this is the one you want ! 
this is a cheap piece of junk that does what it says , it distorts , you want something to make your guitar sound like junk , this will do it . 
why pedals that make your guitar sound like a piece of junk are the most popular is beyond me . 
this is not a boutique distortion pedal like hendrix would use . 
boutique and distortion are an oxymoron.these things are built with heavy metal , it should last , i kinda hope it does n't -lrb- just kidding -rrb- , you want distortion , you got distortion good metal distortion tone with bags of sustain but sucks a lot of tone -lrb- most metal pedals do -rrb- and is moderately noisy . 
if you are looking for classic rock sounds you wo n't find them here . 
can get muddy at times but there are plenty of settings to tweak to get the sound you are looking for . 
i find it useful for high gain leads and palm mute rhythms but note definition is not so good with chords . 
for the price this pedal is a good deal though ! 
excellenti like i am very happyi am looking for money for the following purchase for amazonthe pedal boss arrives in the time necessary thank you for the money , i have no complaints . 
the enclosure , dials , and footswitch are all durable . 
not true bypass , but none of the boss pedals are . 
it does n't suck tone . 
this pedal is n't the end-all be-all overdrive , but with asymmetrical clipping it fills a niche that ts pedals do n't . 
you lose a little low end when it is engaged , but that actually works pretty well for leads - especially with humbuckers or amps with a looser kind of ` classic ' distortion encountered with el84s . 
as a stand alone overdrive , i prefer other pedals . 
but where this pedal really works for me is as a boost to other dirtboxes or an already overdriven amp . 
you get singing , harmonic leads when it is dialed in right . 
like any overdrive , you introduce noise when the pedal is engaged and things can get hissy while you are palm muting if you crank it too far . 
i am a dirtbox hoarder and i like to rotate the pedals and try different combinations . 
lately , i am running this into either the v1 cool cat transparent overdrive -lrb- timmy clone - very , very nice -rrb- or the behringer bo-100 -lrb- which is a dead ringer for the boss blues driver -rrb- then into a tube amp that is dialed in on mild crunch -lrb- jet city combo or palomino combo -rrb- . 
as with any overdrive , this thing will not sound very good -lrb- imho -rrb- running into a solid state amp . 
that 's just not what it was intended to do . 
it was intended to drive preamp tubes into saturation but ymmv . 
because i 'm a cheapskate -lrb- and because these things are durable like bricks -rrb- i bought it used for $ 20 , but it is well worth the new asking price . 
bought one of these 15 yrs ago used and it died a couple years back . 
this is one of my favorite overdrive pedals ever . 
smooth tone , the right amount of gain , perfect to push a tube amp . 
plus there are now dozens of -lrb- diy or pro -rrb- mods available which add a lot more potential . 
recommended . 
this is a standard on my peral board along witht he blues driver . 
this little yellow box is the most bang for your buck you are going to find in an over drive pedal . 
it is tough , sounds like fire , and will serve you well . 
for $ 50 there is seriously no better deal . 
forget all the volume drop comments . 
there is n't any and it does not color your tone one bit . 
i have tried a couple miniature novelty pedals . 
they were more like a boost volume and tone pedal with tremolo thrown in . 
i wanted something to dress up slow ballads , and of course `` born on the bayou '' . 
this pedal goes from nice subtle background affect to deep depth if you want it . 
and no variance in your guitar tone or volume when you click it on . 
i play a lot of acoustic solo and this really is a nice addition to change up my sound here and there and not over do it . 
i use this mostly with my honeytone mini amplifier and reel echo tape echo simulator . 
works very well with no problems . 
a lot of danoelectro pedals may eat up batteries and this is a great alternative when you have access to ac voltage outlets . 
i 've been using a crybaby for going on 30 years now . 
some guitarists claim that having them in your signal chain affects your tone in a negative way . 
well , i 've never noticed.to me these always feel perfect . 
also , you can adjust which part of the sweep you 're using very easily - ie if you want more treble or bass you just the little `` comb '' that moves the wheel on the pot.i 've tried other wahs . 
morley does n't do it for me , and the vox is very good , i just have always gone with what i knew . 
no complaints with the crybaby . 
my cry baby is about 20 years old and is the oldest pedal on my board . 
i have rewired it for true bypass and replaced the potentiometer to give the wah a broader range but it really does n't sound any better . 
this pedal covers the &#34; white room &#34; by cream tone perfectly . 
i gave it 4 stars because it has n't been maintenance free . 
the pot came loose and the switch had to be replaced but considering the fact that it survived several hundred gigs in smoky dives , i probably should give it 5 . 
i 've got a mxr mc404 cae for my concert line pedals ... but this one is the one i use for local gigs and home use with fender telecaster and hot rod . 
finally broke down and got a new one after my original crybaby bought in 1976 finally died . 
a great pedal , well made ! 
it sounds good but it adds soooo much noise to my pedal board . 
if that 's not a problem , definitely worth the price . 
i keep a capo in each instrument nothing wore than showing up without one . 
i am using this on my martin 12-string . 
the spring holds tight but can easily be adjusted with one hand . 
this is my 6th kyser capo . 
this one for my new ovation 12 string cc245 is what i needed . 
i always recommend all kyser capos.they last forever and do not lose the strong holds . 
does what is designed to do easy to use seems sturdy should serve me well for years to come ... was not too expensive for such good quality works great , stays out of the way ... cant ask for much more than that . 
-lrb- and expect to get it -rrb- the price was half of what i was locally . 
works great with my baritone ukulele . 
same quality as my full size acoustic guitar capo . 
easily fits in my ukulele case , too . 
it 's a very cute little capo . 
it works great on my ukulele and mandolin but of course it 's hard to use because when you get into the higher frets the frets are very small . 
but it works . 
you can never go wrong buying a kyser capo . 
they are made to last and really do what they are designed to do . 
the great thing about this capo is that it fits both my banjo and mandolin so i do n't have to have a seperate capo for each.i also have a capo for guitar made by kyser and i can tell you that works just as well . 
you can never go wrong with a kyser . 
not only that i like the idea that it 's an us company . 
i 've had some cheaper capos and they just do n't do the job . 
they either do n't press down on the strings hard enough or they wear out too quickly if they get used much . 
this kyser will last a long , long time . 
yes , if your willing to swap out strap locks with originals these work fine ... i did have a problem with drilling new holes into my guitars ... but its explained what size bit to use so wasnt a big problem ... i tried not to drill on most of my guitars some fit without drilling some did not . . 
good luck ... good price welll made . . 
almost dropped my bass on the floor a couple days before i got these bad boys . 
when i put them on i felt confident that i would n't have that issue anymore . 
it 's easier to strap up because of the quick release tab . 
this should be every bassist/guitarist 's best friend . 
this product is a must . 
why ? 
... . 
because it makes strap install and removal so simple and reliable , ... and when the strap is clipped into place it is secure . 
i 've owned numerous straplok systems on the various bass guitars i 've owned , and would not ever own an instrument without installing this system . 
straplocks have been around for a long time , but now you can use the instrument with a regular strap as well , this dual design sold me on it . . 
easy to install on the guitar . 
a little difficult getting the lock mechanism installed on the strap , still only took about ten minutes to do . 
the added security of knowing your 1200 dollar bass is n't going to hit the floor makes it very well worth the small cost of this item . . 
i use these on my basses and they do the job quite well . . 
they are easy to install on the bass and the strap . 
i was very disappointed in both the quality and engineering of this product . 
a work-around for the main issue follows the review . 
the flaws that bother me in order of significance are :1 -rrb- quality : very weak soft-metal screws . 
using minimal force and a well aligned driver there was some damage to the screw-heads on all 4 that i worked with . 
2 of them rounded out so much that i was afraid they would be hard to remove later , causing me to run to the hardware store for higher quality replacement screws .2 -rrb- engineering : the instructions recommend , and the screws -lrb- the ones that come with the straplocks -rrb- are designed for a # 2 phillips screwdriver . 
however , a standard # 2 driver is too big to fit into the strap-buttons . 
so you are likely to have to choose between grinding down a screwdriver to fit , or using a # 1 which will increase the impact of the first problem above since it is the wrong tool for the job .3 -rrb- engineering : the point of connection for the strap is 5/8th of an inch out from the guitar . 
the strap button has a radius about 3/16ths of an inch . 
therefore any lateral stress -lrb- i.e. weight of the guitar -rrb- is magnified by more than 3x due to leverage pulling outward on the screw . 
a 9 pound guitar would be applying a constant 27 to 30 pounds of force on the screw and the wood around it -lrb- half that when the weight is distributed evenly on two strap buttons of course -rrb- . 
get a little too active on stage and the level of force could go way higher.realistically , if the screws were n't total crap , this might have been a 3 or 4 star review . 
once you deal with the fact that a normal screwdriver wo n't fit and get the things properly installed , it would probably work out for most people . 
so if you are stuck with a set , here 's what i recommend : go to a hardware store and buy # 6 x 1 '' oval-head stainless steel replacement screws . 
note that these wo n't fit properly , but they are the closest match and can be modified . 
-lrb- they are 21 cents each at my local stores , and would have cost dunlop maybe 10 cents more in bulk than what they paid for the crap screws that come with this . -rrb- 
put the screw into an electric drill -lrb- pointy end in -rrb- so the screw head is rotating smoothly when you operate the drill . 
run the drill while using a file or a belt sander to take a fraction of the diameter off the screw head . 
it does n't need much . 
i used a belt sander and it took about 20 seconds each . 
while you are at it , file down a cheap # 2 screwdriver so it will fit into the strap button.install with the new screws as normal , and recommend that your friends try a different brand ! 
i agree with another reviewer that the included screws strip much too easy . 
i purchased a set of these strap locks years ago , and i dont recall having this issue , so i 'm thinking that dunlop changed the screws at some point . 
i was luckily able to get the screws in with some muscle , and the locks are secure . 
however , due to this issue , i 'm considering other alternatives for another guitar of mine that could use strap locks . 
i hope dunlop fixes this issue soon . 
i 've been using these fender straplocks over the last year : fender 099 0818 300 f straplock chromethe problem with those is that they use screws to secure that part that is on the strap itself , and the screw will slowly back itself out and you get yourself a disaster . 
i 've decided to try these because they use a `` dual '' system : you can use the lock on your strap , or just use your `` regular '' strap without the locking mechanism . 
i 've only been using these for a week , but so far , i like them much better than fender 's . 
i think i will replace all fender straplocks with these.i do agree with the others on the fact that the screws are of lower quality , and the screw heads will strip if you 're not careful . 
when i was installing these strap nuts , i screw in a half turn at a time , and applied lots of pressure so that the the head wo n't strip . 
if you can get over the installation , you got yourself a pretty good locking strap . 
good quality , great price , easy to install , easy to lock and unlock , fast delivery . 
better than going to the always overpriced guitar center . 
these are really great guitar locks !! 
i use them on all my guitars , and i would highly recommend them to anyone !! 
these are the only straplocks i use , and i have them for all of my guitars . 
they are the only ones i trust . 
they are solid , secure , and they look great . 
and the push button release makes them pretty convenient too , without sacrificing security . 
love 'em !! 
this the second set of strap locks that i 've owned . 
they are a little difficult to attach to the strap if the thickness of the strap is a bit on the thicker side . 
the quick release and secure connection are great . 
dunlop is not the best strap lock system because it 's a pain to switch which way the lock is pointing and people complain that the button is easy to unhook while playing . 
i can see the merits of screw on locks , what with the ease of switching the locks , but these work fine for me . 
strings are half the battle with stringed instruments . 
a bad pair of strings on a nice instrument sound awful , and a good pair of strings can make a cheaper instrument sound tremendously better . 
either way , stringes drastically affect the sound of an instrument at any price point . 
these strings make my cheap ukulele sound not-so-cheap , and i imagine they would do even more wonders on a uke of a higher price point . 
i also play guitar and martin is one of my choice brands for strings so i figured they would n't let me down when i decided to play the ukulele - i was correct . 
works as it should . 
nice materials and i think it will be durable . 
simple to attach to your mic stand and adjust as needed . 
it will improve your recordings , getting the pops and sssss out of your sound without having to do sound processing as much anyway . 
what a difference a pop filter makes , i use on a condenser mic , it lets me get a little more gain input , clamps on easy and holds good , the flex piece holding the filter could be a little more rigid but does the job . 
i like the way it looks when mounted on the mic stand extension , it has improved the vocal tracks . 
just one more affordable improvement for the home studio . 
great quality and construction . 
does it 's job well . 
only complaint is that if the design were a little more streamline . 
these bolt on with attitude and are a bit heavy . 
overall , stays in place and does it 's job well . 
a workhorse for sure . 
no complaints . 
attaches firmly and does the job . 
ca n't beat it for the price . 
order this with eyes closed . 
great deal . 
it works as a pop filter should and is a huge upgrade over my make-shift panty hose pop filter . 
what else is there to say ? 
i purchased this after reading the great reviews but like a few of the comments that are on here lately this thing is not good . 
looked almost used when it arrived and the gooseneck stand is useless . 
does not come even close to being able to hold up the weight of the filter . 
i would have returned it but i completely destroyed the package getting it open -lrb- which oddly had staples holding it closed -rrb- . 
i ordered this product to use for personal recording , and thought ... what could possibly go wrong ? 
i ordered it `` new , '' and it definitely shows signs that it not new . 
first , the package was stapled , that 's right - stapled together in a way in which you could tell the product had been opened . 
then , to make matters worse , there is a hole in one side of the fabric . 
when i order something new , i expect it to be new . 
based on this product alone , i would not recommend buying from this seller . 
peter piper picked a pack of purple peppers - test passed , no &#34; puh &#34; sound to be found on the recording . 
does not stay in place well . 
i use it with an audio technica 2020 , it work very well , the filter stays in place and it really improves the quality of the recording . 
not much else to say . 
works well but wish it was a bit heavier and the construction was a little better made . 
but other than that works as intended . 
i love this pop filter ! 
it is every to attactch and does n't scratch the mic stand as some pop filter clamps do . 
the adjustable arm is very flexible , yet sturdy to assure you of proper pop filter placement . 
for the price , this is one of the best pop filters . 
it easily clamps onto my stand and does n't move around after i place it . 
however , there is one problem i 've had with it . 
it can easily lose grip of the arm holding the filter . 
what i mean is that , if i pick up the mic , the arm will swivel away . 
granted this was caused by me dropping it once , but before it was fine . 
so for a good price you get a filter that works . 
looks vintage but works great at a great price . 
as good or better than my monster cable for a lot less money ! 
this is my second spectraflex cable and i love them . 
i love their flexibility , options for colors and ends , build quality and price . 
i like to use quality guitar cables for a good sound but i do n't need to spend a fortune on them to be run over on stage by roadies or ripped off because the cable costs more than some guitars do . 
well , what can i say ? 
based on the customer reviews , this purchase seemed like a no-brainer . 
however , after only 4 months of light use -lrb- used on my rig at home -rrb- it is toast . 
the cable barely holds a signal now -lrb- constantly need to jiggle the thing to work -rrb- . 
and before you ask , &#34; is it perhaps your output jack ? 
&#34; , all of my other cables work with my gee-tar . 
so it is definitely the cable : -lrb- anyway , i gave it 2 stars because while it was working it sounded great through my roland jc120 . 
i purchased three of these -lrb- three different colors -rrb- to make a mini-snake for my keyboard to their di 's . 
i typically used mogami 2524/neutrik , but need cakes while in the road -lrb- i usually roll my own to exact length -rrb- . 
these have worked well , quiet , no handling noise , seem well built -lrb- i treat cables well , so i do n't really test them with under tough circumstances -rrb- and hopefully will remain in their spot for the foreseeable future . 
they are used 6 nights a week , and after 50 uses , no problems . 
i recommend them -lrb- plus , for live , the fabric cables in different colors are great for easily identifying which is which for a road crew member who might not know audio well . -rrb- . 
nice pieces ... i 'm a professional musician and love these cables , they look great and perform great and feel a lot tougher than the rubber covered cables i 've been using might work well for recording too when you take the output jack . 
speaker is acceptable quality but ca n't be compared with a fender amp as this one has 5 watts and a small speaker and the other has 10-20 watts . 
i 'm opting for the convenience of the size . 
i got this after getting a couple smaller amps and headphone monitor plugs since it has both and was better sound with good effects . 
i like the ` brit ' setting . 
i sound like a rock star with it . 
good product for practice or recording . 
you could get away with microphone to amplify it for a gig . 
but for around the same price you could get a fender amp . 
this product works for me and the quality is pretty good . 
other mini amps and similar accessories are toys compared to this . 
there are several types of practice amps . 
high end modlers -lrb- line 6 , g dec , vox vt -rrb- that can still run $ 400 + and are typically overloaded with features . 
the low end tubes -lrb- fender blues junior , bug v22 , peavey valveking , etc -rrb- . 
these typically are more stripped down -lrb- in features , not neccessarily quality -rrb- . 
and then there are the micros . 
i always thought they were just a notch above toys , the sort of amps found in a prepackaged guitar set up from wally world at christmas.boy was i wrong ... i needed a portable amp for my son to take to and from practice after school . 
it was important to me that he could schlepp his own gear . 
he 's not a big kid , so even 15lb . 
amps are pushing it -lrb- plus a gig bag and school back pack -rrb- . 
that was initially what brought me to the micro . 
not sound or features , just the smallest possible amp for my little virtuoso . 
turns out this is an amazing amp . 
the tone destroys the line 6 and the features crush the vox pathfinder -lrb- 6watt ? -rrb- 
or bug v12 . 
and the fender frontman - not even in the ballpark.each of the models are distinct . 
the cleans are sparkly -lrb- more trebly -rrb- and the high gain models are very articulate . 
obviously this is n't a loud amp , but that 's not all bad . 
you can get everything this amp has to offer at reasonable volumes . 
it also can be battery powered -lrb- the life is suprisingly long -rrb- , includes a regular wall plug , headphone jack , built in tuning fork -lrb- which is kind of lame -rrb- and a series of onboard effects that can be run simultaneously . 
for example , i was able to crank up the delay and tremelo and pull off some dick dale surpher licks with suprising accuracy.don ' t let the size fool you . 
i honestly thought it was nothing more than a toy and i could n't have been more wrong . 
there are several big websites and it 's tough to find any negatives about this amp . 
quality sounding and durable for a great price.oh - and the red - if you can find it - looks pretty sweet too . 
great little amp . 
i had to take my ampeg jet in for a maintenance and i just love this little practice amp . 
i enjoy using it with both my fender strat and my rickenbacker . 
i bought this amp to replace a squier sp-10 that came with my guitar . 
the squier had no effects , just a clean channel and an overdrive button . 
i could n't afford a bunch of pedals , but i wanted some effects so i could get cool sounds from my electric guitar . 
i saw the reviews for this little amp on amazon and decided to give it a try . 
it is awesome ! 
for such a small amp , the output is plenty loud for practicing at home , and it runs on batteries , too , so i can take it anywhere . 
the effects are better than i 'd hoped for . 
this is certainly not for the pro who performs onstage or with a drummer , but for an intermediate level guitarist -lrb- like me -rrb- who just plays for his own pleasure or to please his family , this is the amp to get . 
it has several modeling functions and you can choose between chorus , flanger , phaser , or tremelo while still adding either reverb or delay . 
i 'm one of the growing number of retirees who decided to pick up the guitar and learn more about it now that i have the time . 
i do n't need the deafening stacks that the kids like . 
i love this amp . 
this pupppy is pretty powerful just running off the batteries . 
we 've used it on a couple of gigs an it worked well with the volume only half way up . 
we are not guitar players and are not using guitars with it . 
we are using an mp3 player for backup . 
the sound is not quite as clear as we get with our roland cm-30 -lrb- so only 4 stars from me -rrb- . 
the micro cube is a lot easier to transport and set up and it 's nice not to have to load up cart to roll around . 
guitar folk will like this unit with the fx features . 
love the case nice and simple , it really look exactly the same as the picture . 
highly recommend to everyone looking for a case . 
this case it built really well , it has really nice plush interior ... storage area for picks-strings-tuning fork-etc in the neck , it does have a lock on one of the latches . 
the case actually kind of stuck the first few days after i got ; so much so that i thought it was locked with the key inside when i first got it . 
turns out thats actually impossible to do with this case unless you have an extra key ... so dont worry . 
just dont be an idiot like me and give it a good tug when you get it.above all it fits my epi lp perfectly ... as it should ! 
hehe . 
very nice case for the price . 
solid construction and perfect fit and protection for my epiphone lp . 
would definately recommend . 
this case is the best i 've ever had ... very plush on the inside , and hard construction on outside is very strong ... the handle extreamly soft to the touch ... i guess all my other cases just do n't measure up to this one ... it even locks ... if your guitar fits ... but this for the quality !!! 
i do some guitar repair work and one of my customers needed a lp case . 
i have bought a lot of stuff here on az so looked at this one and had it shipped to him . 
he says its great so that is my review.prices are always great on az and prime saves me money in shipping .4 stars is my tops , anywhere . 
i could not believe the quality of this case , fits my epiphone les paul 100 like a glove . 
very plush interior , plenty of storage and very durable . 
ordered one of these gig bags for a new les paul - the hard shell cases are back-ordered , and i did n't want the guitar just sitting attracting dings and dust.fits a lp studio perfectly , has room for small items in an outer zippered pocket . 
does the job ! 
i got this for use with the boss dd-20 as a tap-tempo . 
it does the job well , it 's a little big for what it is , but definitely worth having with a delay pedal no problem at all.great quality and i am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand . 
thak you very much ! 
i 'm using this footswitch to control a drum machine . 
it does the job and i 've had no problems with it first off ; let me start by saying i bought this guitar because it was only $ 100 and i was board on my deployment and wanted something to brush up on before i return home.i did not : expect good quality , sound or comfortably from this guitar.i did : want something cheap i could toss around and use out here in the desert without worrying about it getting beaten up or trashed.when i unboxed this guitar i was floored ! 
the hardware is much higher quality than i had expected by far . 
the strings it came with were n't complete crap , but i swapped them out for my favorite set of strings : ernie ball 2406 ernesto palla nylon black and silver classical strings . 
the guitar sings beautifully ; the tone is rich and vibrant.it 's quite comfortable to play , i have no problems playing up to the 16th fret without this guitar having a cut away . 
i 'm not a big fan of the pick guard that has the epiphone ` e ' on it , so i will probably end up removing it ; but the sunburst is really nice looking . 
i have received many compliments on the look of it already.over all : this guitar is a really great instrument for the price tag . 
get it!also ; i 'm buying a hard case to take it home , or shipping this guitar back home to myself because i want to keep it as part of my collection . 
my original thought was to buy this guitar and leave it out here at the rec tent for other people to use after i 'm gone . 
even if i do decide to leave it out here ; i 'll be buying another one when i get home ! 
these are nice , i like the 1.14 rigidity and these are just fine for me ... you will wear them out on acoustics though if you are a more aggressive player as i am . 
once these are worn , as with most picks , they sound considerably different . 
much more grainy and tin-y but that may be a plus for you ? 
i also like the side edges for a real mellow and / or speeding picking style . 
they stay in your fingers well . 
i love the pick attack with these . 
i have used almost everything out there over 20 years of playing and have settled on this pick as my go-to choice for acoustic guitar . 
this is the one that everyone told me i should use , being new to guitar i figured one polish -lrb- car -rrb- has to work well , that was very incorrect on my part , this is for the delicate woods and preserves them far better than ordinary polishes put it in my fender dreadnaught and only wish i have held out for the the next step up in quality with the mic as well ... love it to death , had it pertinently installed and love the sound and the versatility . 
the built in volume knob it a great tough . 
i could go on , but there are reviews on you tube that will do a better job than here . 
i was looking for a sound hole pickup and this came as one of the best and found it to be all i expected . 
i use it for practice and recording myself . 
i really like it but for the price i wish it had just a bit more otherwise its perfect . 
i have it on my 1994 martin d-18 which has a big bottom end and no matter what it always sounds fine . 
i have had the pickup installed for four months and it is good . 
long story short , this string set has a strong metallic character , which distorts the natural sound of your guitar so much . 
many people might like it , but for me , absolutely noooooooo!i have a seagull guitar , so by its nature it sounds mellow , warm and mild with stock strings . 
so when my strings wear out , i got this . 
now i feel like playing an emg bridge on my fender/archtop 's neck position , without the power that an emg pickup has to offer . 
yes , it is that bad , you ca n't do this to guitars like seagulls ... bottom line , i recommend this string set for people looking to boost distortion on their guitar . 
if you have guitars like seagulls or so , definitely avoid this string . 
if your not sure what to buy you are prob looking for the light strings . 
these are a littl ehard to play . 
i am not a connoisseur but nothing great about these strings . 
they have pretty good sound but they seem to die quickly . 
these are nice and sturdy picks.they sound real clean.i 'm having better luck with them on the heavier acoustic strings.i still have to get used to the harder picks for my electrics . 
just the perfect pick i was looking for , i 've tried experimenting with several types of picks . 
finally found the right one ! 
they work as well as any dunlop pick ; they do n't crack , which is a big plus if you use the general fender variety . 
i go a little thicker than i would for regular plastic picks , because they get flimsy after a while . 
take note of the price of the picks and the shipping cost - it might be cheaper for you just to go to your nearest music store . 
i bought the .73 mm picks & i would consider them medium thickness . 
if you like lighter get the smaller thickness or if you like heavy go for the larger thickness . 
the .73 mm is right for me , i really like them . 
love these picks . 
have used them for years . 
feel very firm yet still flex when needed and last forever . 
highly recommend . 
i 've always used planet waves nails but i wanted to try the dunlop buying me this little package . 
a very good experience . 
durable , comfortable and of a texture that makes it easy to use and does not allow them to slip easily . 
if you do n't know what type of pick you like , buy a sample pack . 
picks make a big difference to sound and playability . 
these are thin and flexible . 
easier to use for beginners and easier for strumming in general . 
however the tone is different . 
so you 'll need to decide what songs they work for , etc.as far as quality , these are great . 
easy to grip , and as durable as most . 
i 've used these picks for years with great results . 
if you 've never used this stile picks you wo n't be sorry . 
tortex is great i really like their picks there may be better but these have fit the bill i prefer the yellow ones they are a little thinner i ordered one pack of these and got an entire box !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! either way the picks are great although i would suggest the jazz picks over these i absolutely love the feel of these guitar picks ! 
they are so grippy , i have n't broken a single one yet , they stand out from all of the other junk in my studio , so it 's hard to loose them , but i still do . 
if you have like a child , nephew , niece , sibling , or parent that plays guitar or bass you ca n't go wrong with getting these for them , or if you are a guitarist just playing the cheap little fender picks that break if you strum a chord , and if you are lucky enough not to break them , they just slip out of your hands while you 're playing . 
they are a little thin for rhythm playing however , and i recommend the .88 mm picks for that . 
i have always used tortex picks . 
i like them a lot and they last forever -lrb- almost : -rrb- these were a little thick for my tastes . 
the red ones are a little thinner and give better action for strumming and also for fast alternate picking patterns.if you like a medium thick pick though , these are rockin . 
i prefer nylon picks because they have a softer feel on the strings to my ear - less `` clicky '' - than a standard plastic pick . 
my favorites are snarling dogs brain picks which are very similar to these . 
i guess when it comes right down to it these are essentially the same , i just have more of the brain picks at this point , so i use them more . 
but these dunlop nylon picks are excellent . 
they 're almost impossible to drop , they sound and feel just right to me , and they last seemingly forever . 
hard to go wrong with these if you like nylon picks . 
i like thin picks myself , and this one is very thin . 
you wo n'tuse it all the time , but every now and then it can be used in the right situation . 
if you are a player who is somewhat meat-fisted when it comes to playing and needs to take the edge off , it is ideal . 
also , if you are doing very soft strumming on an acoustic guitar , it is awesome . 
no power chords with this little guy , but it is a good tool to have in the tool box when you need it . 
the non-slippery texture and it 's grippy textured surface of dunlops is what i love about them the most , it makes them easier to hold on to . 
i give them a thumbs up ! 
they 're just great . 
awesome for chord based songs . 
if you need to pick individual notes/strings , then you might want to go a bit thicker . 
with that said , you can do it with these , but the tone is not as nice -lrb- sounds a bit softer -rrb- . 
i would give these picks five stars , but i do have a couple of other types i prefer more . 
still , these are nice picks . 
so far i 've only used them on 12-string guitar , but i 'll soon be trying them out on 6-string guitars . 
ok , so picks are a very personal thing to guitarists . 
i 've been playing for about 30 years now and have used many different brands an types of pick . 
there is no 1 perfect pick for everything , depending on what your playing and your playing style you 'll want to choose different thickness and materials . 
however , i have found this line of pick to be my favorite and my general goto pick . 
my hands sweat and the textured grips on these do a fantastic job of keeping the pick in my hand on not on the floor . 
i also really like the nylon material . 
it produces a softer sound without dampening the overall sound or volume of the guitar . 
i like the playability of the .88 mm as its great for strumming rhythm at loud volume or picking blues . 
i keep a stack of .60 mm for a more raw , folk like sound . 
in any case these picks are great and have been a staple in my kit for many many years and will continue to be . 
alright i got tired of forking over 30 cent a pick at my local guitar store for instant gratification and decided to get some more online , and let me tell you , these picks get the job done . 
do n't expect to be playing metal with these as they are on the soft side but work well for casual playing along with some heavy palm mutes and stuff like that . 
a few of the tips broke off but i think that 's my fault for playing too hard :-rrb- great picks , would recommend to anyone . 
i like these kind of picks because they have some grip to them , normal picks i use slip out of my fingers some times but these dont.if you hate droping your pick while playing , get these . 
i only use dunlops . 
for a number of reasons . 
first , the texture of the plastic gives a good sound , and easier to hold on to . 
second , the `` grippy '' texture they put on them makes them easier to hold on to . 
thirdly , they make many sizes , for all the right occasions . 
two thumbs up ! 
use these for general acoustic guitar strumming , they are not too thin and not too thick . 
i use the .60 mm , .48 mm , and .38 mm . 
sizes . 
the are last forever ! 
much better than plastic ones , especially if you stay in the light thickens . 
th ank you ! 
perfect fit for me . 
i do n't like a pick that is to stiff , and i like the grip . 
my hands sweat a lot so i really need the grip . 
these just happen to be my favorite.i always keep .46 mm .60 mm and .73 mm sizes on hand . 
-lrb- mostly use the .60 's -rrb- i 've been using them for years and so will probably never change . 
i like the ` grippiness ' of them ... . 
i hate smooth picks.picks are cheap so just keep trying different ones until you find one you like . 
i 've been using the dunlop delrin 500 2.0 picks . 
purple ones with the turtle/500 on them . 
i thought i had found my pick . 
because they were so slippery , i had to rough up each side to have enough texture to improve the grip -lrb- i 'd rub each flat side against the edge of a honing stone -rrb- . 
at the music store i stumbled on the dunlop gator grip 2.0 . 
yes they do offer a better grip -lrb- i think they 're still a little slippery but much better than the delrin 500 -rrb- . 
but since i solved that problem with the honing stone , i was more curious . 
so - again , they are better , grip wise , but i was very surprised at the difference in tone . 
they give a much mellower tone than the 500s and since i 'm using these with flat wound 12s on an archtop - the less bright sound often is a better tone overall . 
500s seem to be a harder material and are brighter . 
i do n't know what the gators are made of but i do like the difference in sound . 
i 'm not sure how they 'd work on round wound strings - but great for jazz tones . 
i 've been playing for more than 30 years . 
there are a lot of great products out there and i 've tried a lot of them . 
i have to say that the feel and tone of these grey dunlop gatorgrip 2mm picks surpasses the dunlop yellow gels , fender 351 x-heavies , and golden gate or dawg mandolin picks . 
this is just my opinion , but i hope you 'll check them out because i 'm sure you wo n't be disappointed ! 
i use the 1.5 mm dunlop gator grip for twenty years . 
the non-slip surface does n't take long to wear off , but i have a work-around . 
i 've even put them in a vice , and filed new points on them . 
i prefer an extra heavy pick because there 's no delay from pick deflection . 
this pick is great for strumming . 
some people are complaining about the grip but they are better than celluloid picks in that regard . 
if you are looking for the best grip you need to find a pick that has a textured grip . 
i started doing a lot of fingerstyle guitar playing , and it seems to have made my fingertips slick . 
so i have a hard time holding on to picks -lrb- when i use them -rrb- on upstrokes . 
i 'm sure i could improve my technique and fix the problem , but it 's more fun to blame the pick ! 
these picks were no different from picks without the &#34; gator grip &#34; imho . 
but gorilla snot worked beautifully . 
i got these picks a week ago and have fell in love with them . 
i generally use a dunlop 1.0 m pick , but have to switch to a thinner pick for rhythm play . 
this , of course , can be very annoying , especially if playing rhythm and lead parts in the same song . 
these big stubby picks have solved that problem . 
they are easy to hold onto , great for leads , and because of the way they are shaped do n't hang on to the strings like the regular picks do . 
great picks . 
definitely worth the little extra they cost . 
these picks have a very unique shape and sound that have helped me play faster with a smoother tone.unfortunately , these picks did not receive a five-star rating because of their price and lack of durability . 
they wear down fast . 
mine are usually worn out after a day of use and i do n't think i play particularly hard . 
at around $ 4.50 for six picks , these are some expensive pieces of plastic.however , these picks are so full of awesome that i am compelled to pay a little extra . 
i will definitely be buying more . 
another item never received but i would not use anything over .88 mm anyway was mean for experimentation i have learned since this purchase . 
i bought these wanting to try the nylon big stubby but was sent the lexan / clear purple ones instead . 
i wanted to mention this because the item description is vague -lrb- plys pk -rrb- and the item pictured is nylon . 
i 'm still happy with the purchase these have the same picking dynamics as the jazz stubby but they give you a much larger surface to grip . 
i bought my first set a long time ago and they were perfect ! 
then i re-ordered and i got what i think was an acoustic type because they were the same 2.0 mm gauge but were too small for me to comfortably hold , so i just ended up with two dozen wasted picks . 
so just make sure you get the right one .12.5.11 update : okay , so i just realized that there are `` dunlop stubby picks '' and then there are `` dunlop big stubby picks '' sorry ... i love these picks . 
great for lead playing , and with small fingers like i have , they feel great ! 
nice quality pick . 
i do like this pick as well . 
it 's the third color of the same pick i purchased . 
i will probably always use these . 
they work good . 
way to stiff and small for me though . 
great attack but holding onto it is the problem . 
the slick finish makes it kinda hard to hold onto and the small amount of pick that shows makes strumming difficult without hitting your finger on the strings . 
i imagine it would work great for lead players but i 'm a rhythm player . 
nice tone , very easy to grip , last me a long time . 
one of my favorite picks i 've tried for electric . 
do n't enjoy them as much on acoustic . 
i have used the extra heavy picks for many years but am still searching for that perfect pick . 
its strong enough to play metal and some blues style rifts but not so strong it cracks and brakes . 
i do like the fact it wont turn to powder or fray while playing either but it does wear out fast when playing on heavy gauge strings . 
i actually forgot that i bought the heavy and medium versions of this pick . 
it 's not a bad pick , i will continue to use them but i wish they had a softer center , or softer coating where you grip the pick to prevent it from turning or falling out of my fingers . 
i drop my pics on purpose now just so i can use it more often ! 
it does what it 's supposed to do , what else can i say . 
this pick holder is awesome . 
it just snaps on to your mic stand ... add 6 picks and start rockin ' ! 
it holds the picks securely so if you 're performing outdoors the wind wont blow them away . 
i put it on the boom of my mic stand . 
tight on some , not on others . 
i need to put a shim on it for some stands to keep the picks in place . 
it 's nothing special . 
no frills , just a simple concept that works . 
it 's important to maintain humidity in your instrument , especially in a dry climate like west texas . 
the evaporation rate will depend on the amount of humidity in the air where you store your instrument.so , when you first start using it , you have to be diligent to check the sponge regularly to ensure that it is still moist . 
purchased this to replace the dampit as a no drip alternative . 
with the solid base it will not drip and it fairly easy to use . 
distilled water will extend the life of the sponge . 
overall simple and effective.however , i may have added too much humidity . 
was using in conjunction with humidipak to keep them from drying out thinking they would absorb any excess humidity , but i then noticed an irregularity in the reflection of the pick guard and the tone seemed to be muted so shifted over to humidipak only and will re humidify them outside the guitar case.i do use a hydrometer but i do n't think it was effectively reading the inside of the guitar , but only the inside of the case.so i think the planet waves humidifier works well for its intended purpose , but you do have to monitor that you are not over or under utilizing it . 
i wish it was a little longer lasting but it does do the trick . 
my guitar would probably not be happy without it . 
we all know it 's just a container with a sponge in it , no biggie . 
i bought it to get super saver shipping on something else and because i plan to keep an all-solid acoustic guitar at a weekend place where it will sit unused for long periods of time . 
jamming it between the guitar strings and getting it hooked onto them feels a bit rough on the strings . 
but it should do the job . 
i agree with the others reviews . 
the sponge is too small and too thin but the humidify is small so it would n't fit any larger sponges . 
okay for the price . 
i am in agreement with others that state this is a must-have . 
i battled with fret noise on recordings and fingers dragging on the fingerboard . 
this really lowers the friction and makes for a much more playable instrument and supposedly protects the wood . 
i 've used it on the back of the neck as well and it helps as much as on the fingerboard . 
i rub the entire neck down before and after i play . 
it makes the guitar smell like it came right from the shop , which i suspect is what they must 've been using all these years and never told me , though i never did ask ... foolish me . 
since i 've recently gotten into doing my own setups , where i 've read many forums and posters have recommended this and i figured what the heck , it 's less than $ 5 . 
i discovered this string lubricant many years ago and i concur with what most of the reviewers here have said about it although i would n't call it a string cleaner although you indirectly clean the strings if you use the cloth and like another reviewer stated you should also use the cloth to clean the undersides of your strings as well . 
i unfortunately live in a very humid climate being only a little above the equator and so strings have a very short life here and so anything that can prolong their life is a real boon for a musician here . 
i agree that the only downside is the inability to tell in advance that you are running low on lubricant until it actually turns dry but i guess given the price and the overall usefulness of this accessory , one can not complain too much . 
now that mine has just run dry i 'm going to delay a replacement purchase while i try out something new that i 've just discovered called `` the swipe '' which enables me to clean both the undersides and the topsides of my strings without chemicals . 
if this works as well as advertised , i may still get fast-fret but for its lubricating properties which really helps make playing a lot more comfortable.recommended ! 
this product is not what it seems . 
it has a cool name , but that 's about it . 
it 's a tool oil that stinks . 
i tried my best to get use to this product , but learned that there are much better ways after going into the studio and recording for the 1st time . 
after doing away with the fast-fret , my playing has improved and i hardly ever have to change my string because of gook . 
not to mention that getting that crap on my fingers was just nasty . 
i now use old english and my guitars thank me , my nose thanks me and my fingers thank me . 
you will too ... seems to work well , though i do n't know how long it 's supposed to last . 
i have sweaty hands , and when i 'm done i wipe my guitar down with this lil guy and it helps a lot to keep the strings from getting dirty or cruddy . 
i got this product to clean and condition my guitar fretboards -lrb- well duh ! -rrb- 
does it work ? 
yes and no . 
first it did not appear that anything was coming out . 
after a bit of rubbing i did notice a &#34; slight &#34; bit of solution -lrb- turns out its mineral oil -rrb- on the fretboard by the frets . 
i tried to spread it out with the included cloth and discovered that the cloth was useless -lrb- a paper towel would hold up better - seriously ! -rrb- 
i used an old tee shirt square and spread some of the oil around - but honestly it took me 10 to 15 mins and i noticed no difference in the appearence or the playability of the guitar . 
it says to use it before and after each session - thats about 30 mins of my time per guitar -lrb- i general play 2 guitars durning the course of a session -rrb- . 
i do still use this occasionally , but i would not spend money to purchase it again . 
just not what i was looking for in a fret board cleaner . 
i 've already posted about fast fret . 
i love this stuff . 
it 's a mandatory inclusion in every one of my guitar cases . 
i think this patch looks cool on the bass . 
i do n't really hear any difference in sound , but does give your drum head a better life span i needed a new strap but i did n't want to pay $ 20 for one . 
i saw the ernie ball ones and decided to give it a shot . 
i 'm glad i did . 
the strap is awesome . 
it 's very very comfortable and can expand longer than any strap i 've ever had . 
it totally deserves 5 stars ! 
perfect size for us big guys . 
i do recommend some snap locks for it though ... . 
for the money , this strap is as good as any other poly strap . 
plus , it was made in the u.s.a. ! 
i 've only used it a few times but this strap looks like it 's here to last . 
no frills , just a plain black strap . 
i 've always loved the ernie ball straps from playing it all the way down to your knees , all the way up to you chest the strap never fails , i 've owned countless ernie ball straps and i always come back to them for the main reason , i 've never had one fail ! 
a great strap for a great price for at great price , this strap does all that it is suppose to do . 
it is very will made , has the ernie ball logo on it and works just fine . 
what you see is what you get . 
it 's cheap , it 's basic , and it works . 
the best thing about this synthetic product is the price , and color options ! 
great inexpensive strap . 
really , what more can you say ? 
i wanted something to hold my guitar up , and it does just that . 
cheaply made and thin leather leave a lot to be desired . 
at least it 's long enough for even the lowest slung of guitar postures . 
this should accomadate a bass as well due to the extra length.i am comparing it to $ 10 guitar center straps which have double leather ends which are much sturdier than the ones on this ernie ball strap , which are thin and single ply . 
i would n't trust this strap without a strap lock . 
this makes the second one of this straps that i have ordered and i love them . 
they are longer than your standerd strap and that is great for a big guy like myself . 
i do n't have not one bad thing to say . 
great buy and will do it again if i ever need anouther strap . 
this is a very nice guitar strap in light gray . 
the strap material and the double-leather ends are heavy duty and should last a long time . 
i got this at an awesome price too ! 
product does what you would think . 
i use it on my bass and have n't had a problem with it yet . 
if you are constantly playing shows , this may not be your first choice , but if you just need something to hold your guitar or bass up , then this is it . 
you ca n't beat the price . 
i have both black and white ernie ball straps , really comfortable , easy to adjust , holds guitar securely , and both colors look great with black guitars ! 
i 've used this strap on different guitars and it works great on all of them . 
if you 're looking for an economical strap this will work great . 
my experience has been that ernie ball makes great products . 
my preferred strap was a hand made leather with my name on it , but it was n't adjustable . 
i bought this one for its adjustability . 
this is my second sm48 in 25 years ! 
what 's the difference between the 58 and the 48 ? 
the 48 is made in mexico . 
there is a noticeable difference in tone with the 48 with the on/off switch . 
-lrb- i did not buy that one -rrb- if feedback is an issue in your practice space , get the one with the switch , otherwise opt out for better clarity.i say go for it !! 
save $ 50 . 
put away your effects pedals , modellers , and software for awhile and get back to the earth - or at least the simple appreciation of what an electric guitar sound can be , straight off the axe with nothing but pickups , volume , and tone pots to shape it.for me the classic pignose-and-a-strat sound is the opening of `` i looked away '' from layla , but i 'm sure everyone 's got their favorites.loud enough to `` feel the air '' and coax a variety of natural-sounding distorted tones . 
stick an sm-57 in front of it and fool a lot of people into thinking it 's a tube amp . 
by working your guitar knobs you can get a clean sound , along with that `` barely breaking up '' holy grail of tone for many blues and rock players.by learning how much you can do with relatively little , you 'll gain a new appreciation of the strengths and weaknesses of all the tone-shaping tools that have come along since.it might surprise those who take today 's hyper-saturated , over-processed metal distortion for granted as the official , community-sanctioned guitar tone to discover the challenges and pleasure of touch and response with subtle dynamics and without infinite sustain.one bit of weirdness : when i began playing my pignose i immediately noticed a buzz , as though something small was rattling around between the speaker cone and front grill . 
the four mounting nuts were easy to loosen and , sure enough , an extra washer had gotten caught in there during assembly . 
fortunately it slid right out and there was no damage.get the power adapter and save the batteries for when you absolutely have no choice.the first amp i ever had was a small ampeg tube from the early 60 's with a single 6 inch speaker , volume and tone knobs . 
i 've no idea how many watts it put out - not enough for my parents to complain from their bedroom next door . 
with that baby cranked , i spent many happy hours in tone heaven . 
all these years -lrb- and amps -rrb- later i guess i 've always been searching for that sound and the pignose comes closer than any tube distortion , blues overdrive pedal or rat-ty box i 've tried.for the money , you ca n't beat it . 
sounds simply great ! 
as greasy as a pignose has to groan and as simple as it has to be . 
great on bass notes and can also get clean with highs ; it does sound different when opened and by moving the guitar volume , it changes its distortion -lrb- the louder , the more distorted -rrb- . 
the pignose power supply -lrb- pignose ac9 power supply for pignose 7100 -rrb- is helpful when been home , but also works with 6 aa batteries . 
you can also amplify it 's sound by connecting it to a higher-watt amp . 
it comes with really nice looking stickers . 
i 'm planning to keep it for years.update on review -lrb- jan 9 , 2013 -rrb- . 
i admit that it might be more expensive that other 5 watt amps , but as time goes by , i just fall more in love with my piggy ! 
i 've learned to use better it 's own volume combined with the guitar 's . 
i have other amps of higher power that can get a lot louder that the pignose , but i just love the level of distortion it gives ; i can not get this crunch with the other amps , no matter how much pedals , bells , whistles i have tried ... this crunch is unique and the world loves it , as simple and plain as that . 
the good thing is that it has an output at the back to connect it to louder amps and like that you can have at louder volumes that unique crunch i so much fell in love with.the 7 chords give a clean amazing sweet-grumble -lrb- the one that make teenage girls sigh for you ... -rrb- with high volume on the piggy and low on the guitar . 
this mic stand will work great for mic ` ing full stacks and guitar amps.some people have mentioned the counterweight could be heavier but they need to pay attention to how they are orienting the feet in relation to the microphone . 
you should make sure one of the feet is pointing in the exact same direction as the microphone arm so that way the downward force is applied directly onto the support leg . 
this is a great stand for anyone looking to mic up their guitar amp , seems well built and rugged , although the mic clip is just a cheap plastic component you should immediately replace ! 
i use this with fairly light mics -lrb- seenady dmk-5 drum mic packagefor details -rrb- . 
while i generally do not mic bass drums , when i do this stand allows me to do it my way , which may seem unconventional to some folks . 
i place the mic on the batter side of the drum about three feet back . 
since this can be problematic with the floor tom and throne -lrb- and hi-hat -rrb- hindering access , the boom and adjustability of this stand are a great help.where the stand shines if micing amps . 
some small amps , such as thefender champion 600 electric guitar amplifierare usually placed on a raised surface to keep them off the floor . 
this stand will reach any stand that is chair seat height . 
for larger amps that are on the floor or tiltback stands , this mic stand will still allow you to position the mic where you need it.my use is relatively narrow - kick drums and amps . 
but for each , this stand is excellent in my opinion . 
with the mics i am using it is heavy enough to remain stable , and for where i need to place those mics , it allows me to do so with relative ease . 
this is a well made table top stand . 
the weight of the stand holds the mic and wire in place with ease . 
i would get this stand again . 
i have quite a few mic stands , and picked this up to use for micing a guitar cabinet . 
i love the low profile and the design of the feet - it 's very sturdy , and all around better than the dr stands that i have which cost twice as much . 
it has plenty of weight to it and enough reach to easily reach all 4 speakers in my 4x12 without becoming &#34; tippy &#34; .5 / 5 , though it would have been nice if it shipped with more than just the single cable clip . 
i purchased this for a friend who has just taken up playing the violin , she prefers it over the rosin that came with her student violin because of the wood that forms a grip around the rosin . 
i had some other rosin that was just a mess to apply . 
this rosin is great because it 's encased in a wooden sleeve that leaves your fingers free of rosin . 
it 's so easy to apply and does n't leave any messy residue on my fingers . 
i have n't been playing the violin for very long but did know i needed something to rosin the bow easily . 
this was exactly what i needed . 
this is an original gibson gear replacement part . 
do n't change your knobs or any kind of part in your gibson -lrb- les paul , sg or any other -rrb- if not for the real deal . 
i have a les paul and i definetely intend to maintain its value in the long term by using original parts . 
besides , they look great and will perform their job for many , many years ! 
i replaced the metric pots in my greco lp and needed new top hats . 
these look great and work perfectly . 
i was unsure what kind of polish to get for my guitar . 
i would have thought pledge would work , but after a little reading i found out that could be bad for the woods tone and resonance . 
after scoping out amazon i came up with this product , and i am happy . 
it makes my black guitar shine and is very easy to use . 
it also comes with a nice polishing cloth ... great deal for the money . 
last forever and easy to hold onto . 
not much more to say but there really isnt much more that needs to be said . 
my favorite picks . 
i recently bought a bunch of picks of different gauges and materials for a shoot out . 
i think you have to see what kind of tone you are looking for - yes , even in a pick -lrb- sorry guys ! 
- but for me , this material and gauge had a full sound , without being thin and the material feels best in the fingers . 
-lrb- i previously used .63 gauge acetal claytons . 
clayton 's rule ! 
been using since they debuted and will never change to anything else.long lasting and great tone besides.awesome.yes , indeed.khjghjjh hgkjhgk i 've been useing this pedal for several years and it does the job . 
yes , it could be metal , and i wish the button gave a satisfying ` click ' when i step on it . 
for under thirty clams i can look past these things . 
i have not had any issues with noise -lrb- crackling or oscillation -rrb- . 
i really have no complaints at all with it 's performance so i am glad i did n't shell out 3-4x more money so i can feel more secure when i unlatch my pedal board in front of gear-snobs . 
i do n't think i need to run this pedal with every amp i own but it does a great job ` opening up the sound ' of boxy or dark sounding amps . 
when i run it in the effects loop of my palomino v8 -lrb- great little practice amp btw -rrb- that little amp sounds huge . 
also great in front of my blues jr. . 
if you own an amp with a single tone knob -lrb- pro jr , valve jr etc -rrb- or if you find your tone stack lacking responsiveness you owe it to yourself to buy one of these . 
even if you are satisfied with the responsiveness of your amp 's controls , this pedal can double as a volume boost when playing lead . 
once my sound is dialed in , i leave typically leave it on and forget about it . 
it 's also pretty indespensible for shaping the sound of your amplified acoustic guitar - had this for about 3 years now - it works great , and for 30 dollars , it was a heck of a bargain.the construction is ok - it 's plastic with a metal + rubber bottom , but seems sturdy . 
battery is easy to get in and out , and comes with one -lrb- but is not shipped connected to the terminals -rrb- . 
signal wise , if on , it adds a tiny amount of hiss and static , which raises the noise floor by a hair . 
the noise is n't noticeable unless you are paying attention when turning it on or off . 
besides , if you are boosting the high end , you are going to get hiss.works great in front for a clean or unclean boost , but i tend to use it in the fx loop - where it does what it 's supposed to do . 
i think it 's a must for getting the most out of an existing amp setup , especially if the amp 's eq is n't doing it for you , or the cab or speaker choice is less than optimal - this thing fixes it all!i would definitely choose this over more expensive eqs , but i tend to take good care of my stuff . 
i love these strings , i 've tried others but i always come back to these , great for beginners , the phosphor bronze provide a lower/deeper tone that i prefer , but still very bright . 
i read the reviews on ernie ball strings . 
i have to say that i love the strings . 
they have a rich sound that brings my acoustic alive . 
who say 's ernie ball ca n't make good acoustic strings . 
this set sounds just fine and for the money forget about itthanks amazon ! 
: o - -rrb- i have a cedar topped acoustic and these strings brought it to life without losing the cedar smoothness . 
no mud , clear mids and highs with clashing . 
mounted them with the brass tone pins and this guitar just rings like a bell now . 
love it . 
i bought a guitar and for a while used the strings that were provided with it . 
after a month of using those strings i decided to replace them since i was having trouble keeping the low e string in tune . 
i put these strings on and compared to the &#34; default &#34; strings , it was almost silky and softer by comparison.i 'm guessing the guitar came with steel strings and these are nickel . 
the sound was much nicer to my ears as well . 
they were relatively inexpensive and made a great choice for replacing the strings on a new guitar . 
these are the gold standard for all strat type electrics , fender or not . 
i put these 150 's on all of my strats regardless of the brand . 
they are durable enough to take a pounding and sound great . 
i tend to play my strats a bit rougher than my gibson 's or acoustics so these are well tested in my house . 
i get a bit carried away with amp volume and tend to bend the strings a bit . 
i will continue using these on all of my strats until i find something better which i have n't yet . 
i do use other strings on other types of guitars and you can see my reviews on those as well.these are bullet proof . 
they take a pounding and last as long as you could expect !!! 
decent strings i used for a beat up strat that i had . 
nothing to special but it was good enough for that . 
i 'd recommend these . 
same kind that come on all guitars from the fender factory . 
classic sound . 
i have switched to d'addarios to capture that frusciante sound . 
have always liked ernie ball products , so i thought i would like to try their strings , to see how they work , i am very pleased ! 
i built a cbg recently and decided to go with these strings as suggested on several websites . 
the sound i get from the ad&g strings sound great wit the piezo pickup and a tube amp . 
the strings seem to hold up well . 
i can not comment on how well they hold a tune because anyone who knows cigar box guitars knows that keeping them in tone with parts like round head bolts for a nut and an eye bolt for a bridge can be an uphill battle . 
these strings sound great , i was thinking of stringing my electric acoustic guitar with them also to compare the two styles of playing . 
it holds all my acoustics perfectly . 
it 's light but stays in place okay . 
rubber pieces are soft enough and seem like they 'll last a while . 
two really nice things about this design : 1 -rrb- it folds up very nicely and becomes pretty small , 2 -rrb- the all black and slim arms/legs design makes it look nicer in a room . 
it pretty much disappears when you put a guitar on it so i 'm able to have it out without offending my wife . 
:-rrb- i have 7 of these stands for my 7 guitars . 
i have 4 classical guitars , 2 flamenco guitars and 1 acoustic steel string . 
it 's very durable and easy to set up and the guitars never tip over . 
it 's a really great , quality stand for the price . 
they do n't take up a lot of room and they 're very light and portable if you want to take them with you to a gig or if you 're traveling . 
i highly recommend it.my guitar teacher suggested that i keep my guitar -lrb- s -rrb- out because he said that if i kept it/them in a visible , easily-accesible place that i would practice more , even if it was just a few minutes and he was absolutely right . 
instead of zipping them up and putting them away in their respective bags/cases after each practice session , i have them all out and displayed and i definitely practice and play more because as soon as i step into the room - there they are , i just pick any one of them up and start playing . 
it was a simple tip that sounded like common sense but i had n't realized that i always had the excuse that i did n't have time to practice -- but really the effort of getting the gig bag and unzipping it and taking out the guitar even though that seems like very little effort and does n't take up a lot of time , for some reason kept me from practicing . 
i guess out of sight , out of mind . 
but now i keep my guitars out , and i also bought a music stand and i keep the music i 'm working on and the stand out . 
yes , it takes up room and stuff but whatever gets me to practice more and play more is always very helpful . 
inexpensive . 
light weight yet sturdy while holding a guitar . 
folds up and can easily be stored . 
highly recommend this for the guitar player . 
i 've got three of these simply because they work and they 're easy to carry from place to place ... and i insist on a stand for my guitar , none of this &#34; leaning ' stuff . 
i like the size of the stand and the flexibility . 
easy to put together and holds my guitar very well . 
i knoew i did not want any holder that took up too much room in my music room , not did i want something that would tip over if i blew air on it . 
my instructor of the guitar suggested i really read the information about all of the holders and then make my choice of the one that seemed to be light-weight yet sturdy to not fall over , looked professional , and could be the possibility of the one i would recommend and purchase again . 
i really like the stability of the one i bought . 
bought this on a whim and i am glad of it , i have not used the string winder part yet but the cutter makes short work of both guitar and mandolin strings without the risk of marring the head , just be careful you can pinch yourself if you are not careful . 
it works fine for the regular guitars but the bass guitar has these very wide tuning pegs . 
this winder has a slot that will sorta fit across this tuning peg but it does n't feel like it has enough of a grip to make turning it easier.i have n't had a chance to actually use it while changing strings yet , but so far it looks like it 'll work as advertised in every other aspect . 
this is such a lifesaver -lrb- or an effort saver -rrb- . 
every guitarist should have this . 
in my opinion , there is nothing more annoying in the world than changing guitar strings . 
this makes the process so much easier . 
it 's a 3-in-1 product that clips the old string , pulls the pins out , and winds the new strings in . 
on top of it all , it 's pretty affordable . 
i was a bit concerned about this tool after reading some reviews that owners had damaged expensive guitars , but thought i would just be careful with it . 
but i have no concerns after using it on two string changes . 
in fact , i can not see how one could nick the guitar while winding , since the tool does not even cover the entire tuning key so it never gets close the guitar head . 
the string cutter works great , one squeeze and any size string is cut cleanly . 
the pry tool for acoustic guitar pegs works , and though it is a tighter fit than i expected , it does work and means i do n't need to find a pliers . 
overall , i am very pleased and saved time on string changes . 
makes stringing so much easier with the peg puller , and cutter all in one . 
arrived quick and before scheduled . 
these work perfect for my needs i 've only used the string winder so far , but it works well so far . 
i use it on my guitars and my banjo . 
the other things look like they will work well , but i have n't used them yet so i ca n't say for sure . 
if not then i 'll update this review -lrb- if i can -rrb- . 
this winder makes changing strings a breeze and i like that there 's an integrated cutter to trim off the excess string . 
i also love the part on the end that pulls out the pins from the bridge . 
so , this item is three tools in one ! 
i have had other string winders , but this had the string cutter on it too . 
it is awesome . 
i broke a string on stage and instead of having a big floppy string , with just a quick squeeze it looked good . 
highly reccomended not much better than the dollar version of the peg winder . 
thought it would be more ergonomic and having the stringer cutter in one tool would be a plus ... . 
but , not quiet up to par . 
you 'll be better off with the dollar string winder and a cheap pair of snips . 
not as sturdy as some i 've used and seen floating around , but it gets the job done as advertised . 
not a terrible buy . 
construction is a bit on the cheap side , though , as it is mostly plastic and seems a bit fragile around the edges . 
the clipper and winder work well , though , even though they are both predominantly made of the same lower grade material . 
however , all you really need are the two functions , and they work . 
it is a string winder , what more can i say . 
it works as it should and saves time . 
very useful when restringing a guitar . 
this bad boy rocks , fits in guitar case , it slices it dices it makes julienne fries . 
well no , but it does slice guitar strings in half and it will pull bridge pins and wind/unwind guitar strings , though.if it had a flashlight , tuner and fingernail trimmer it would be perfect , but engineers are mortal and i could n't put a tool the size of a watermelon inside my guitar case -lrb- at least not without coating it with butter first -rrb- . 
its plastic and steel , it will break eventually as everything does - imperfect world , re &#34; breakfast club &#34; bolts fall out , doors fall off , but til then i 'll enjoy using this . 
the string winder is a little awkward . 
i have a little fender brand gizmo that looks like a pez dispenser with a swivel head on top , its small so i keep it in the guitar case along with this contraption - winds strings much faster than this device , but if you 've got the time this one will work just fine . 
i also wear two pairs of socks in case one gets a hole in it , i 'm prone to redundancies.it may be sheer rumor , but i have it on good sources , that this item is actually based on alien technology recovered at roswell new mexico . 
your chance to own alien technology at an affordable price not like those i-phones that they took out of the saucers.if it only came in mink it would be perfect . 
i 'm not sure how much extra utility you get out of the winder . 
maybe if you change strings a lot , then this could be a key part of you equipment bag . 
the cutter part is nice , it is solid and effective without being too heavy , yet it does feel well made . 
for the price , keep it around rather than tracking down other wire cutters when you need to change out a set of strings . 
i bought this mainly for the string cutter , although it has a peg winder and a bridge pin puller as well . 
at first i was skeptical because it 's lightweight and the cutting ends are not sharp . 
i was wondering how well it could cut the loose ends of strings . 
i 'm happy to say that it does an excellent job , much better than the pair of diagonal pliers i was using . 
it cuts the ends of strings easily and cleanly . 
it 's nice not having to carry the pliers around , which are heavier and a little risky to your guitar should you happen to drop it or accidentally mar your headstock . 
as for the bridge pin puller , i tried it once but it is rather ineffective . 
i think it was included more as an afterthought as it 's just a notched edge and ca n't really pull stuck pins . 
for pulling bridge pins without damaging the bridge i would recommend the dunlop bridge pin puller which is inexpensive.overall i give this 5 stars for the winder and cutter . 
i 'd recommend this to any acoustic guitarist as an essential tool to keep in their guitar case . 
it cuts the string and winds the pegs much easier than one could do by hand . 
it is very solid and will last a long time . 
nice quality and love the cutter . 
the winder is a little awkward to use . 
i guess i need a little practice . 
but the cutters are great . 
the winder works really well and same with the cutter , but using the cutter can be a bit cumbersome . 
i guess for taking w / you on gig bag would be great as you only have one tool , but if using at home , then i think is more convenient to have a separate cutter . 
that 's what i do anyway . 
still i think is a good tool to have . 
overall , i like this winder . 
it 's handy having the wire cutter built into it . 
but when i am winding new strings , it often slips off . 
since i am using one hand to hold tension on the new string , i would prefer this to hold on more securely so i do n't have to put it back on several times . 
but all in all , it 's a lot better than winding by hand , and it seems sturdy . 
it beats doing it the old fashion way and the cutter is sweet , but it could be better .1 . 
it slips off if you go too fast , but i thought that was the purpose of using a gadget like this .2 . 
it did n't come with much of any instructions , so i was using it wrong at first . 
there is a big and a small slot .3 . 
the cutter is so that i pinched my finger during use . 
the cutter works great , you just have to be careful .4 . 
the screw that holds it on keeps coming loose . 
sure i can tighten it , but it just means the design could be better.all and all it 's one of those must have gadgets , but it does require a little discipline to master . 
i hope the next version comes with a soft , rubber insert so it does n't scratch the chrome off my turner pegs . 
that and maybe they could use a long screw and some loctite to keep it from coming loose . 
and well , maybe they could offer it in more colors to make it easier to find . 
everything i have seems to be jet black . 
i 've had string winders for years , but never a multifunction one like this . 
i recently bought it for my niece , and taught her how to change her strings.the different size gaps make it ` grab ' the tuning pegs much better than my old one . 
i was able to use it on an electric , steel string acoustic , and classical , and it grabbed them all rather well . 
the string cutter works well , and the peg puller does also . 
so handy ! 
header says it all . 
works well enough as a string winder , but i was really lookin for something to pull my bridge pins with and for me , this did not work well at all . 
went back to my trusty rubber tipped pliers and just had to be gentle . 
a good piece of kit . 
accept it does have problems removing occasional sticky string pegs . 
it 's also squeakily noisy when string winding . 
the cutter works perfectly . 
it works well for guitars and basses , so long as they are the clover style . 
other then that it works just like it says it will . 
i like dunlop products but ... the push down applicators -lrb- dunlop 's dab-o-matic applicator tops -rrb- are horrible idea . 
one popped right off the other day and oil got all over the place . 
i will not buy these again or i will remove them and just use a cloth . 
this kit has just about everything needed to clean and maintain your guitar or bass . 
i would also by the dunlop lemon oil as well . 
worth the money . 
granted , i 'm no expert on what 's out there in the world for guitar cleaning materials . 
this is my first foray into that world.but , i 've used it , and it 's easy . 
the polish is great , the cloths are soft and just what they should be ; the wax is wonderfully shiny and easy to put on and buff . 
everything here is , as far as i can tell , just as advertised - a way to keep one 's instruments in good shape.i now have a shine on my guitar that is better than when it arrived from the factory , and there does n't seem to be any chemicals in the stuff that corrodes or otherwise destroys the guitar , like perhaps some fly-by-night cheapy cheapy product maker might offer.maybe there are better polishes and waxes out there - and knowing the way the world works , i 'm sure there are some , probably made out of rare elephant glandular excretions that sell for $ 500 a bottle that the pros use and maybe would be worth 6 or 7 stars on the amazon review . 
i do n't know . 
but come on ; this stuff is just fine . 
makes my guitar look great , from the fretboard , strings and body . 
everything conditioned and polished . 
great quality product , highly recommend the dunlop system has everything you need to keep your guitar in good condition , and looking great . 
it also had two soft cloths that are needed for application , removing excess and polishing . 
i could n't be happier ! 
a good value box set of quality products . 
use these each time you re string and keep your instrument in top shape . 
i do guitar set ups for folks and these come in real handy . 
nice little kit . 
it has 800 grit sandpaper in it , i had n't noticed that in the listing , maybe i overlooked it . 
i had just bought some 600 grit at homedepot and used on the neck of a used guitar that had been neglected for nearly a decade . 
the 600 made it glassy smooth again -lrb- wet sanding -rrb- - i used this instead of the 800 that came with the package and it worked well for me.i had made the mistake of waxing my fretboard with carnuba wax after reading about it on a chat board . 
big mistake it deadened the sound terrible . 
i was miserable , my guitar sounded like s *** . 
after 20 minutes with this kit and a new set of strings and bob 's your uncle , good as new . 
i 'm going to use this everytime i change strings on all my guitars.nice little kit , i might even get around to using the 800 grit paper that came with it one of these days . 
works a charm on acoustic guitars , have n't tried it on the electric guitars yet . 
does the job nicely , i use these for me guitar thats set for slide playing and i 've not had any problems with them . 
good solid strings i play progressive and thrash metal , and these strings hold out nicely . 
tuned them down to a sharp -lrb- b flat ? -rrb- 
and they sounded sweet . 
back up to e -lrb- standard -rrb- and they provide nice full sounding tone . 
i have used ernie ball strings for along time . 
mostly slinky 's or super slinky 's . 
i read the review on these and thought i would give these a try for the sound they make paired with a lp.i bought these to replace the stockers on the epi lp 100 i just bought . 
luckily i order two packs . 
i was putting on the top e string and had turned the crank less than a few times , not near enough tension on the string yet to even be in tune yet , and `` pop '' it broke . 
i had ordered two sets , so i put on the one from the new set . 
no problems until i got to the g string , then `` pop '' another breaker . 
very sad quality.after finally getting them on and in tune -lrb- you will need to stretch the top 3 strings alot to get them to stay in tune , especially the e -rrb- i have to say they have a great sound to them . 
nice tone and sustain . 
great crucnhy sound for metal , but still a good clean tone too . 
these are thick strings , but still bendable , just not very far . 
i would rate the sound 5 stars.unfortunately , it takes two packs of strings for one successful stringing to occur because of how brittle the strings are . 
so i have to give these three stars overall . 
i 'm not a metal player in any means but sometimes i do get the urge . 
if your gon na play metal you need bigger strings than just 46-9 . 
so i got these and they are awesome . 
they are not too big or too small . 
very happy with these strings . 
if you want great strings get fender strings . 
they are the best out there . 
but for metal -lrb- big strings -rrb- i stick with ernie ball . 
these strings actually save you money because you do n't have to change em much . 
i keep em on a year or so and i play alot , out door indoor . 
constant abuse . 
they never rust . 
when they break i change em.now . . 
i 'm not a player who likes new strings to begin with so i like not having to change em . . 
they really hold up . 
there are better sounding strings yes . 
but if your plugin in anyway , you can tweak the tone.the tone is n't bad , just not as good as a martin uncoated string.but if you like longevity and less squeak . 
these are great . 
i heard about these from a friend , several years back.i teach and run a mobile recording studio and use my guitars all the time for mobile music recording and for worship services.these strings allow me to keep on keepin ' on for several weeks at a time , even with constant usage.i wipe the strings after use and they still sound bright and crisp after many sessions . 
-lsb- ... -rsb- i buy elixirs with all my acoustic guitars now . 
they last the longest and hold the brightest and clearest tone of any string i 've ever used . 
the nanoweb coating really does make a huge difference . 
they take several months to wear out -lrb- as opposed to the weeks other major brands last -rrb- . 
they may cost a bit more than the competition , but if you try them and love them as much as i do , you 'll never use anything else again . 
i 've used these strings longer than any other strings i 've tried -lrb- about 7 years -rrb- . 
last year i switched to d'addario exp16 's because they sounded better on the guitar i have now , but still keep a pack of nanowebs as a backup . 
here are my pros and cons of this string : pros : + easier to fret and play than other strings . 
i do n't know why ; i looked up the tension stats on these strings and they seem to be equivalent or higher than other strings . 
but they certainly are easier to fret -lrb- press down -rrb- and play than any other string i 've tried , including other coated ones . 
the coating on the nanoweb strings is thinner than the elixir polyweb series , but still feel very smooth and even ` slippery ' , as some people remarked . 
they have very little string squeak . 
+ last longer than any other strings i 've tried - maybe because of their brightness , these strings mellow with age -lrb- as all strings do -rrb- but never really sound dull . 
the only reason i saw to change them was when they became overly dirty or broke , usually every few months of regular playing . 
+ very bright sound , which cuts through well playing live with a full band , and livens up the sound of cheaper guitars . 
however , this can also be a con -lrb- see below -rrb- cons : - cost more than most strings , including other coated strings.-can sound overly bright , especially on some higher end guitars . 
they tend to dominate the sound of the guitar , which is good for cheaper guitars without quality woods or construction , but not so good for a guitar that already resonates well . 
for this reason i switched to the exp16 phosphor bronze string for my current guitar . 
the exp16 is coated but has a more natural/dark sound that complements the ` woodiness ' of the guitar better than the elixirs -lrb- although not as easy to play -rrb- . 
- not available for export outside the u.s. . 
when i was working abroad , i used to buy these from a u.s. company who would ship them to me . 
elixir changed their policy to prevent this , so i ended up switching strings because the cost of elixirs abroad was so high . 
i have a taylor 514 ce acoustic guitar and elixir strings are what this very nice guitar came with from taylor when new . 
i figure they have done the research on what works best and i see no reason for a change other than going fro the extra light strings to the light weight strings . 
the sound you get with the nanoweb strings are amazing and they enhance the results from an already great guitar . 
they also last a long time before they go dead . 
great set of strings . 
cant go wrong with elixirs a little over priced but i am hoping to get long life out of them to make up for it . 
these are great guitar strings and are all that guitarists say they are . 
they are so tuneful , they make an ordinary acoustic guitar sound beautiful . 
my only concern is that if the strings are n't wound properly they seem brittle and break . 
e.g. low e and a strings and the vulnerable g string.the light version i find , are particularly suited to finger picking . 
great great great great great great great great great . 
been uning them for years . 
love the sound and playability and durability . 
matin coated are good too . 
i hesitate to write this review simply because it 's pretty obvious nearly everyone else loves these strings . 
to be honest , i was very , very impressed with their feel and handling . 
i do think they 're the best playing strings i 've used when it comes to pure playability . 
hands down , none better . 
they were butter-smooth and great for flat picking . 
but for me it was a trade-off , because i simply was n't impressed with the tone . 
i even took the time to try them on three different guitars -lrb- all dreadnoughts -rrb- : a classic maple sides/spruce top , a mahogany back/sides with spruce top , and a maple backs/sides with a nato top . 
on all three , i did n't like the tone as much as the strings i was using . 
i really wanted to like them , but they simply did n't have the tone of the medium gauge martin sps i normally use.this is n't to say they 're not great strings that sound different on other peoples ' guitars , but i simply did n't like them on mine . 
i love good projection with rich bass tones and ringing treble for the folk and traditional music i play in our jam group . 
the elixirs just lacked the punchy high tones of the martin strings i use , and the treble sounds tinny vs. the clear ring of the martins i normally use . 
to be fair , the bass strings sound great , and are n't much different . 
i would have to say choose your strings carefully based upon how you 're going to use them . 
i play in acoustic groups , and the elixir strings just do n't have what i need to be heard , in spite of how great they feel under your fingers . 
if playability is more important than great tonal range , then by all means buy these strings ... you wo n't be disappointed . 
i 'm guessing these would be fine on an acoustic electric , where the electronics could compensate for the weaker treble tones . 
compared these all in medium .013 's on a taylor 210 dreadnought ... . 
martin sp bronze & phosphor bronze , martins lifespan sp , dr , d'addario ej17 phosphor bronze , and elixir nanoweb 80/20 bronze and phospher bronze . 
i tried them back to back . 
switching back and forth . 
narrowing it down to d'addario and elixirs . 
i did the same with these 3 sets . 
one day i 'd try all 3 playing along with a cd . 
then i 'd try a different set every 3 days . 
the elixir 80/20 comes out on top . 
best sounding of all , smooth on my fingers . 
second , elixir phospher bronze , last was d'addario . 
i 'd be satisfied with the d'addario they do sound good . 
but the elixir sounds & feels better . 
these are perfect . 
hard to beat strings . 
they last , keep in tune , and keep their tone . 
they do n't need any string cleaners either . 
so you can save money on that . 
an obvious noticeable difference between the medium gauge and the light is that these medium gauge are not recommended if you like to finger-pick a lot . 
but boy ... . 
are they bright ! 
enough to blow the spruce tops from pine trees ! 
not two weeks after i put these on the a string broke close to the ball on the string . 
i break high e strings on occasion . 
but something as thick as an a string ?? 
maybe it was a defective string as i thankfully bought two sets and i was able to pull the a out of the other set and it has been fine since . 
now however i have the dilemma of should i just buy more strings and just use the second set as i need them . 
further more do i stick with the same brand . 
that is supposed to last longer than average strings . 
at this point i am going to keep playing this set until its time to change then go from there . 
i will update once i decide if i should stick with this brand or go back to super slinky ` supdate 3/25well another month went by -lrb- a week ago -rrb- and the d string broke in the same fashion leaving me to believe i either got defective strings are these strings are not as good as they are said to be . 
either way its losing another star . 
if it happens with a different set of strings i will reevaluate my guitar/review and change accordingly i bought these strings after buying some elixir strings for my acoustic , which i was pretty happy with . 
for my strat , however , these strings did not sound right from the start . 
after about a week i really started wondering if it was just in my head or if i really did n't have sustain that i thought i usually got from a new pair of strings . 
i convinced myself that it was these strings that were causing all my problems , and i was right . 
i put a pair of d'addario xl 9.5 -lrb- highly recommended for those players who ca n't decide between 9s or 10s -rrb- and was amazed at how much tone and sustain i was losing with these elixir strings . 
i did feel like i could move up and down the fretboard easily with these strings , but the lack of sustain and tone have forced me to stay way from these electric strings permanently . 
do n't let the higher price on these strings entice you , go with a good set of d'addario or ernie ball strings for consistent long-lasting strings . 
without changing my pickups or polishing my frets , i thought i 'd try to get a little more sustain switching up strings . 
at first i thought i had got a bum buy because the i had to bring the action up a bit to account for the over brightness of the strings . 
had my tone all off and i was ready to dig my other set back out of the trash ... . 
played on it for a half hour -lrb- went through the exact same thing with the polywebs i put on the rg655 -rrb- then retuned , sounded pretty good . 
played for another half hour and retuned and it actually sounds great now . 
dropped the action back down and it 's smooth as silk in an hour 's time . 
very highly recommend the title says it all . 
they 're elixirs , you just ca n't go wrong with elixirs . 
trust me , i 've played for 13 years . 
i put these on one of my gibson les pauls ' and so far so good . 
great sound and no wear after one session , unlike the d'addario strings.i will update in a few weeks as i see how long they last . 
bought these for my son 's electric guitar . 
he loves this brand ! 
they sound great and seem to last longer than other brands . 
price is great ! 
after all these reviews i expected the greatest strings ever , golden strands of glory that would last for a year with sparkling tonal perfection!instead , i got a decent set of .10 's that lasted a whole hour before the d snapped at the neck pickup . 
i use a prs with a wilkinson bridge that rarely breaks strings , and i pre-stretch them gently but completely . 
plus i tune down to eb for vocal and breakage reasons , so i break very few of my normal strings , slinky .10 's . 
ergo , a break in one hour from a thick string under minimal tension , tuned down , is unacceptable , especially when these strings cost three times as much as most all other electric strings.as for the tone , it 's definitely bright and almost too edgy , but nicely zingy all told . 
yet one negative i 've noticed after about 8 hours ' loud playing with a drummer is that these things seem to vibrate more widely than most strings , making them harder to tune . 
sounds odd , i know , but when i replaced the d with a slinky d -lrb- replacing singles ai n't cheap either at triple the price , please note -rrb- , i 've since noticed that it tunes faster and in a tighter range than the elixir strings.so , i must say i 'm summarily unimpressed so far with elixir electric strings.what 's the good of string lasting a long time if it breaks fast?especially when it costs three times more?and what 's up with the tuning thing?and why do these cost so much more , anyhow ? 
is a micro-thin coating of siliconish stuff really worth two bucks extra each string ? 
not when that string is toast in 50 minutes , zero doubt there.anyhow , i 've got five elixirs and one slinky on my main ax now , so as they age i 'll get a good feel for how the elixirs stay in tune and hold their tone , and i 'll report back here in a while . 
and by the way , that slinky d sounds almost exactly the same as the elixirs , tonally . 
so much for magic elixir tone.don ' t get me wrong , i really do want to love these , as i hate changing strings , but geez guys , how about some quality control?if i 'm going to pay triple the price , then is it crazy to expect triple the quality ? 
or heck , even just a little better ... ps if you look at the d'addario reviews -lrb- i love their acoustic strings -rrb- , they respond to many of the reviews and questions . 
i hope that elixir will do the same here and address my questions . 
-lsb- edit : and now , after only six hours ' of playing on that guitar , the b string popped at the same place as the d , neck pickup . 
once again i ask : what good are strings that `` sound good three times longer '' if they break three times faster ? -rsb- 
-lsb- edit : 10/31/12 . 
come on ! 
after four more hours , the a string went . 
i only play that ax one or two sessions a week , and the next time i joked to the drummer , `` which one will go today ? '' 
he said he 's amazed the g is still on , as he plays too and knows the g takes the most tension . 
an hour later , guess what ? 
yep . 
so that 's four broken strings in less than 20 hours ' play . 
seriously?not only are these not a good deal for 9 bucks , i 'd be bummed if they cost 3 bucks . 
the only plus i can think of at this point is they sounded good when new , but dang , unless you play totally smooth jazz or some such , i 'd stick with slinkies or d'addarios . 
unless i got a `` bad set '' , which seems kinda lame for triple the normal price . 
in any case , these elixirs were just not worth the money . -rsb- 
-lsb- edit , 3/3/13 : i called elixir and told them about the multiple breakage , and they sent me another set . 
that set has taken a few four hour hard rock sessions with no breaks yet , thought the tuning issue remains . 
i 'll add a star for good customer service and the hope that perhaps my first set was a dud . 
but honestly , at this price , there should be no duds at all . -rsb- 
love elixir strings ! 
i bought my first pack , over 7 years ago and i 've been hooked . 
they last , at least , twice as long as traditional copper wound strings , and sound even better . 
get these ! 
these make my cheap $ 50 acoustic guitar , sound almost as good as my martin ... no kidding . 
purchased these strings after having tried blue steel strings on my son 's acoustic guitar . 
he prefers the elixir strings over the blue steel strings . 
he says they last a lot longer and sound better , too . 
elixir is my favorite brand of strings . 
i bought these seeking strings with longer life -lrb- after a bad experience w / d'addario strings only lasted a week or 2 -rrb- and boy i 'll tell you these babies last ! 
i only change these strings twice a year & the coating makes it more comfortable & easier to slide on the strings . 
i love the bright sound you get and they are easy to tune & they also keep in tune good & overall these string are a must try for every guitarist what can i say , i am a string snob ! 
ive tried many different kinds of strings for my acoustics and the elixir nanowebs are by far the best strings i have ever played.i had a set of another major brand on a cheap washburn i bought , and i changed them out with these strings and wow what a huge difference . 
the guitar has such a great ring to it.also use these on my taylors . 
these will give any quitar a beautiful voice!pros : lifesoundplayabilityquality and durabilitycons : price i have tried many types of steel strings . 
my taylor 355 came delivered with these - and though i have tried several others , i have returned to them . 
their ease of play -lrb- smoothness to fret and finger -rrb- and light but rich tonality makes them a good choice for your 12-string . 
have n't tried 'em yet ? 
pick up a set - they are different and , in many ways , better than the more standard phosphor bronze strings that were the best before these came along . 
changing strings on a 12 string less often ? 
fantastic !! 
and the sound is good . 
i did n't expect this much volume from light strings . 
the tone of the strings lasts about 4 months , in my experience , but that will depend on how much playing you get in . 
these strings are great for a 12 string . 
i started using coated strings on all of my guitars last year and have gotten use to the smooth feel . 
a 12 string is a little harder on the fingers so the coating is nice to have . 
they sound as bright and clean as any uncoated string i have used on this guitar . 
and i think they will last longer . 
which is nice because the guitar is really not much fun to restring ! 
being from tampa , i wanted my first guitar to be a dean . 
sure , there are plenty of other options out there , but i just had it in my head thats what i wanted . 
well , i must say i am very happy with the purchase . 
guitar arrived in its triangular shelf box , inside another dean shipping box , which was wrapped in bubble sheet packed inside yet another , larger , amazon box . 
was essentially ready to play right out of the box , with a few quick turns of the tuning pegs . 
one knock on it i have seen online before buying was that the tuners do n't hold tight , i have not yet had this problem after a week of playing it , including some drastic bends . 
checked with a steel straightedge and a light , the neck was dead flat and straight . 
the edges of the frets could use some more finishing , they are still a bit edgy . 
i have seen others mention filing them down a bit , same thing that would be done on a more expensive guitar at the factory . 
i will probably get some diamond files and do this as well , i keep hanging up my hand on them on the bottom of the neck . 
i 'm no expert on tone , but this has a nice even sound and responds well to pretty much any pedals or effects i 've thrown at it . 
i did restring mine with the dr neon multi-color strings for using with rocksmith , which required adjusting the intonation . 
the low e and a strings ended up at the very end of their range , and the a is actually still a tiny bit flat . 
this could well be a factor of those particular strings though , so i wont knock the guitar for it . 
as others have noted , the finish can vary drastically . 
mine is much darker than the stock photo and the grain is much less noticeable . 
overall , looks a nice piece , especially for the cost . 
i could not ask for better for this price . 
from what i hear from more experienced players , as i progress i could easily upgrade the tuners and pickups , though i think i will leave this one alone and just get a higher end guitar when its time.overall : nice looking , feeling guitar for a beginner.pros : excellent value.good quality construction.feels and looks good right out of the box.can be upgraded in time if you choose.cons : tuners may or may not slip when playing hard.finish is variable , be willing to except whatever shade you get . 
i purchased this key on a whim . 
when it arrived the instructions were not clear , but i sat the dial to # 2 , loosened all of the lugs on my floor tom and went around my lugs using opposing lug patterns , and tested the first cut of tuning . 
too loose and deep , so i increased the setting to # 3 and repeated . 
almost the sound i wanted , so i used a regular key and went an eighth turn using the same pattern . 
perfect . 
i then started on the next largest tom , working back to the smallest . 
using the # 3 setting plus an eighth turn i got my toms 1/2 octave apart.next i worked on my snare drum , starting with the snare side , then the batter side . 
i used # 4 on the batter side and # 5 on the snare side , and managed to get the crisp , yet warm , sound i wanted . 
the bass drum came next - i set the batter side tension 1 notch below the resonant side and achieve a great tuning . 
from there i went back and set the resonant sides of each of my four toms one notch higher than the batter side and marveled at the perfect tuning i attained.this is an easy device to use - with the lever facing you move it to the left , loosen all of your lugs , then tighten each starting with one or two . 
when the lever clicks and moves to the right position you have reached the torque setting . 
test , increase a notch if necessary , and repeat until you get the sound you want . 
set the resonant heads either one notch higher or lower to make sure the batter and resonant heads do not cancel each other -lrb- and to your desired sound -rrb- , and you will have a perfectly tuned set.i 'll never go back to tuning by ear ! 
you 'll be amazed by the results if you tune with this key , and do n't forget to write down your optimum settings . 
this is my second 4 way switch and it wo n't be the last . 
the four way gives you an added combination of neck and bridge in series , which gives a fatter tone than position 2 and more output than positions 1,2 , or 3 . 
i am very pleased with the &#34; new sound &#34; of my tele . 
the wiring diagram is very easy to understand and the install is pretty easy if you have a soldering gun . 
-lrb- do n't forget to lay down some newspaper to protect your guitar finish from solder -rrb- . 
great solid switch . 
works well for giving your telecaster the option to run your pickups in both series and parallel . 
as for those who have questioned if the travel is too much for some switch plates all i can say is that i have this in several of my teles and i have never had a problem with the switch travel being too much for the plate . 
i didnt have my research done correctly and ordered these because i wanted &#34; vintage &#34; for my &#34; relic 'd &#34; build . 
clearly my mistake that these do not fit the cheap necks sold here on amazon . 
but no worries , amazon sells adapters to make the &#34; large &#34; holes in the neck fit the &#34; smaller &#34; vintage tuning key posts .1 star off for not looking like the higest quality . 
i 'm happy though and this was a good purchase at the right price . 
another easy modification for my indonesian telecaster squier . 
better looks and function . 
tuning is easier and holds longer than with stock sheet metal guides . 
i am upgrading my chinese fender strat with american hardware . 
i own an american strat too and plan on making the best of the chinese one . 
going to upgrade electronics and everything else too.these are exactly what 's on my american strat5 stars these fender string guides are replacing the old style string guide -lrb- tree -rrb- . 
installed on a tele i built . 
much less surface of the string touching . 
very smooth action when using the vibrato . 
took no more than 10 minutes to install . . 
reasonably priced , super upgrade . 
i recommend this product to anyone with string guides on their guitar . 
these look like rollers , but are not rollers . 
they do work well . 
and i will purchase more for other tele 's and stratspros : well made cons ; none i can think ofsleek , well designedquick installimproved soundinexpensive upgrade used on an old tiesco 3/4 size guitar i refurbished for one of my grandsons . 
guitar tuned easy and holds tune well . 
he plays it for hours at a time people complain that these are n't really rolling string trees , despite the fact that the description * never * says or even implies they are , in fact , `` rolling '' string trees . 
honestly , they do n't need to be , at least for most guitars . 
these small , round guides are superior to the flat , wider styles of most string trees because they have way less actual contact with the strings . 
less contact means less friction , less friction means greater tuning stability since your strings do n't have as much chance to get caught up on anything when they move.i put them on a cheap telecaster copy i have and noticed the results immediately , and i did not replace either the tuners or the nut , those are still the cheap stock parts.if you have a whammy bar and you bend a lot , rollers might be a little better , but for five bucks this is an easy upgrade -lrb- anyone can change them , all you need is a screwdriver -rrb- , it was a no brainer for my telecaster . 
a great , clean look for the otherwise ugly string guide clamps . 
the guides on these are not rollers , but are the next best thing visually and performance wise in my opinon . 
the only guides that i like better are the round 50 's guides for tele 's , but then i like those asthetically only on tele 's . 
an inexpensive mode that looks and works great . 
to the inexperienced eye this simple , clean looking mod can make a mexican or chinese instrument look more like the made in america models . 
i works as advertised . 
what can i say ? 
it 's inexpensive and does what it 's supposed to . 
just buy it and move on . 
this capo is one of the best made i 've seen . 
it fits the neck of my electric guitar perfectly and stays securely at any position.very well constructed . 
easy to attach/detach . 
dunlop capos are functional and inexpensive . 
come on , capos do n't have &#34; tone . 
&#34; just get one that does n't get in your way . 
also , the people who work at dunlop seem like nice guys . 
thank you , dunlop , for keeping it real up in benicia . 
the only negative to this well made capo is i wish the tension was slightly less . 
i find that once placed , notes played closer to it are slightly sharp even using light pressure . 
it will work out just fine though and i will just have to make a few adjustments in tuning to correct for this . 
i have n't used it a lot yet , but i really like it so far . . 
much easier to put on than the 30 year old capo i was using , and it works for my guitars and my banjo , without putting them out of tune . 
it seems to be solidly made as well , and not too much pressure as others said . . 
my old capo put a lot more pressure than this does :p , and was much heavier . 
i 'd assume it was made out of cast-iron or something instead of aluminum . 
liked this capo it worked fine . 
you can double this as a hand exercise device since it has a great amount of tension . 
i 've used the classic kyser capos for years with my acoustic guitars . 
they definitely look great , but they tend to lose their tension and allow for string buzz after a year or so . 
that 's my experience at least . 
these trigger capos may look and feel awkward to a lot of people , but they are wonderful . 
i get a perfect barr at every fret and it feels like this will never wear out . 
i 've had one for a couple years now and the only problem i find with them is that your friends tend to take them for themselves and it 's easiest just to buy a new one . 
highly recommended for acoustic guitar players ! 
you know when a good quality item arrives , everything looks and works just as it is intended . 
i love it ... a quality , low-cost capo that is so easy to use that does a perfect job and claps on the guitar strap out of the way when not in use the jim dunlop 83cb capo has a powerful spring and works on both 6 and 12 string guitars . 
just squeeze and slide it where you need it . 
available in several finishes to match your taste . 
i really like the one-handed operation , and i really do prefer that the access to it is behind the fret board instead of out front . 
that makes it easier to reach for a quick change , and for easy on/off . 
i 've been a jim dunlop fan for more than 40 years , and this product just reinforces that ! 
i have owned other capos , but this one is simply the best . 
i does n't take up a lot of room on the fret , yet the springs are strong and will hold properly for a long time . 
i had always used the kyser clip-on-the-top capos -lrb- and still do -rrb- , but i liked the look on this dunlop clip-on-the-bottom model . 
it works great and looks better . 
grips the neck well and keeps the strings immobile even when strumming real hard . 
feels a little awkward trying to put the capo on with one hand , but i guess that 's how all of them are . 
works very well on acoustic guitars if you have n't used these picks , get some . 
they are the perfect size and shape . 
your really ca n't beat them . 
like other reviewer wrote previously , i received less picks than advertised -lrb- i received a total of 7 picks -rrb- . 
i do n't know if the people at customs `` borrowed '' some from me , but i find very strange that more than one person is having the same problem . 
other than that , the picks are good , seem to be durable and produce a nice sound . 
this is my guitar pick of choice . 
i fits well in my hand and is well balanced . 
have tons of picks , but seem to use this one all the time . 
the fender medium is my second choice for picks.my first is the ` just strings ' pick that is the exact same shapewith a softer -lrb- less scrape -rrb- feel on the strings at half the price.pick choice is like guitars and amps ; everyone has a different opinion . 
maybe a little bigger than i 'm comfortable with , but my guy friends with the huge hands love these things . 
they keep disappearing . 
i bought these picks because i liked the color of the picks.these picks surprised me with how good quality they actually are . 
i play guitar everyday for around 3-5 hours a day and i have yet to break one of these picks . 
very nice quality and very cool color to them . 
they are also priced very good.much cheaper buying them here at amazon instead of a quarter a piece at the guitar store . 
recommend these picks to anyone that plays guitar . 
additionally , they are very fast at shipping them to your door . 
three days after ordering them they were sitting on my door step . 
these picks far exceed my expectations , i mean how good could a pick be anyway ? 
these are the classiest , nicest looking picks i own . 
they look great , feel great and play great . 
call me a snob , but i wanted these to match my fender stratocaster . 
kind of like using a gm part on my 68 chevelle . . 
if you own a fender and want to spend just a few bucks for a &#34; feel good &#34; gift to yourself , buy these.i love the color and texture too , they do n't slip or move around as you play . 
i bought these as spares -lrb- and they look really cool too ! -rrb- . 
i think everyone has used fender mediums at some point ; these are no different . 
reliable , last a while and more important they 're inexpensive ! 
hey i got this and an `` ovation idea '' from go-dps . 
i couldnt be happier with these items , especially the `` ovation idea '' !!!!!! i have to brag on `` go-dps '' some , they are wonderfull dealers ; i look forward to buying from go-dps again . 
i love these picks . 
medium is the perfect size for me , as well as the majority of people . 
this is a great looking pic and you get 12 of them at such a great price . 
i would n't buy anything else . 
i have played guitar for most of 40 years and have used about any type of plectrum made . 
i have used coins and washers at times.my favorite pick for years was a fender heavy and then i went for the really heavy brands like dunlop or clayton but found they are way too heavy and were eating my tone . 
i went back to fenders and then found i like the medium best.fender makes these in the coolest colors now so i went with them . 
price them at a store and you will come back here.these came from go-dps which is no big deal as i shop on amz enough to know they use secondary sellers a lot of the time.however , i ordered a lot of stuff the day i ordered these and the full exhaust system was in my house 5 days later . 
these did n't show up so i contacted amz which goes back to go-dps . 
it took nearly a month to receive an envelope containing 12 picks . 
it did n't kill me not to have them - i have a million picks , i just wanted to see these in my hand.that said , i will definitely buy these again in the future and go for the different colors.great price , great picks . 
i read the reviews for the bad shipping in the box & decided to take a risk since i really wanted to try fender picks & really wanted heavy picks & the shipping definitely improved it comes in a little plastic baggy & has the fender logo on it . 
but the picks takes a little getting used too there very slippery at 1st i thought it was just me but i lended a couple to a few friends and they had the same problem but overtime you develop a better grip on them and can alternate pick , sweep pick , tremelo pick , tap with the pick better . 
also my pitch harmonics -lrb- better known as squealies -rrb- come out clearer to me . 
overall the product is not an disappointment & im only using these pick -lrb- just in different colors -rrb- from now on ^ . 
^ i use these with ernie ball regular slinkies . 
i find that if you stay right in the middle then you can play a very wide variety of styles . 
it 's also cheaper . 
these picks are exactly the right thickness and they play well . 
look cool to i will buy more when the time comes i wanted to experiment with a thin pick . 
i like the action but thinner picks tend to `` click '' over the strings and i do n't care much for that . 
these are certainly pretty though , and the feel is typical fender celluloid , smooth and a little slippery . 
might be hard to hold with sweaty fingers . 
celluloid is highly flammable , so be aware of that if you smoke -lrb- i do n't -rrb- . 
simple , compact , well constructed , easy to use , and sounds good ; all things you would look for in a capo.this is the original shubb capo , designed for most acoustic guitars with metal strings . 
the shubb website describes the huge range of specific capos they make , each with their own specialized use . 
the c1 is probably the most universal of all the models . 
this fits a les paul traditional 08 -lrb- gibson les paul traditional plus electric guitar , heritage cherry sunburst -rrb- , aprs se custom 22 guitar , grey black with tremolo bridge , andepiphone lp special ii les paul collection electric guitar , vintage sunburstelectrics . 
the primary use is for a laguna acoustic.follow the simple instruction card included with the capo to adjust the tension . 
it 's key to not get too much tension.we 've had trouble figuring out where to park this capo . 
mostly it goes in a pocket . 
once the capo is adjusted to fit the neck , it does n't clamp tight on the headstock . 
not a huge deal , but a consideration . 
researched around for a highly recommended capo and the result is the shubb . 
this is a capo that while is not easily adjustable to slide up and down like other spring types , it 's a great capo and very durable in construction and material . 
like a good guitar that is well cared for , this is something that 's great to hand down to the next generation.please click yes if my review have been helpful to you , it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews , and leave a comment if you have any questions , i will be more than happy to answer if i can be of help . 
for those of you going for the folk singer look , or if you 're afraid of drilling holes in your guitar , this is definitely the thing to buy to strap your guitar . 
i love this cable , they look good and are well made too . 
an incre&iacute;ble guitar cable , i really recomended it , i have the 12ft and this one 21ft . 
try one . 
i was n't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable , but i am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.i did a little experiment . 
i plugged in my old cable , played the guitar as i adjusted the amp until i got a pleasant sound from the speakers . 
then , i turned the amp off , unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new monster rock cable . 
next , i simply turned the amp back on -lrb- the sound levels were already set and i did not touch them -rrb- and played my guitar again . 
the volume was louder and i think nicer with the new monster cable.i 'm buying a few more monster rock cables to replace all my old cables . 
i should 've just got this cable the first time . 
i have been using monster for years . 
i recently tried a coiled guitar cable and learned the hard way . 
i bought this monster cable -lrb- 12 feet , angled -rrb- and plugged it into my create amp . 
wow . 
clear and no static . 
i can also wrap this monster up easily because it is not stiff , but very plyable . 
heavy duty and rugged , it should last forever . 
thinking about buying another one . 
great stuff . 
the monster chord is great looking , but for me , they are too stiff . 
i play an acoustic guitar , so i do n't run around a lot . 
the cord must be made to be able to take some abuse , but i do n't need that . 
for me thia is the best cables ever . . 
i mean they give the original and natural tone of ur instrument , doesnt lose signal strenth and a very important thing , they do help to avoid most noise . . 
:-rrb- very well made . 
no problems . 
should be able to stand up to any use or abuse . 
piece of plastic with no bracing . 
due to design , will not attach to stands that have a turned lip on the shelf -lrb- which is most quality stands -rrb- . 
i used double-sided sticky tape -- problem solved . 
gives me a place to stow my guitar picks , tuner , capo and pencil and as such , is an invaluable accessory . 
worth the 6 bucks , just be aware you may have to improvise when it comes to attaching it to your stand ! 
could not get to fit small sound hole . 
once in sound hole pickup did not work at all . 
would not buy it . 
but unless you are new to guitar , you know that . 
these strings are more expensive because they are supposed to last longer . 
really , i ca n't tell that they do . 
or that they do n't . 
they sound great , and play great and i usually purchase d'addario or martin strings . 
not sure if i would pay more for these in future , i play an average of daily to every other day depending on what gets in the way . 
change the strings every couple of months . 
just me at home so no big deal , if i were performing i would go through them faster.i 'm giving 5 stars because d'addario makes great strings . 
` nuff said . 
good strings , though in 1 use i didnt notice any significant improvement over the standard diaddario phosphor bronze strings . 
the benefit of coated strings is , as the box says , longer life . 
this is due to your natural finger oils not corroding the strings and sapping them of their natural `` life '' , i.e. that brightness that new strings have . 
the drawbacks to coated strings is that they can feel unnatural or slippery depending on the coating - they are also the latest rage in guitar strings and allow string manufacturers to charge more than basic commodity strings.so are these any good ? 
yes , they feel great , not overly slippery or coated , and sound great , though they appear to have a more muted tone than some strings . 
i 'm excited to have them on my acoustic because as a mostly electric player i change my acoustic string less and am hoping that the coating will fight the grime that build on them and allow me to enjoy them longer.about gauge . 
these light strings go from .012 to .053 as compared to my old martin 's which went from 0.012 to 0.054 . 
in summary , d'addario makes good strings and these are no exception . 
if you 're looking for coated acoustic strings with a muted -lrb- as opposed to aggresive -rrb- tone with lighter low e , then you should check these out . 
after playing for years with elixir nanoweb 80/20 's , i decided to experiment with a few different coated strings . 
i tried the elixir nanoweb phosphor bronze , dean markley alchemy gold phosphor -lrb- now discontinued -rrb- and these exp16s . 
ultimately , i preferred the nanoweb phosphor bronze the best , but the exp16 are cheaper and the difference did n't warrant the extra cost , so i decided to stick with these for now . 
i was n't a fan of the alchemys because of their rough texture and high tension . 
the exp16s are smooth and have a very playable tension , although not as smooth and easy as the elixir 80/20 's . 
as far as longevity , these seem to last me about 2 months , which is on par with other coated strings i 've tried , accept for the elixir 80/20 's which average about 3 months . 
uncoated strings last me about a month.depending on the style of play , i prefer brighter or warmer strings , but i 'd rank the exp16s somewhere in the middle . 
it 's a good balance for both strumming and fingerstyle . 
even though they do n't project as well as the elixir 80/20s , they have a very agreeable tone without some of the harsh overtones . 
for live use with a pickup i 'd be more inclined to use the elixirs , but for unplugged or mic ` ed use i like the tone of these . 
we have an old acoustic around the house , but i rarely play it , opting instead for the electric . 
this is going to be hard to believe , but the strings on the acoustic were last changed more than two decades ago.when we put these new strings on the guitar -lrb- lotus -rrb- , the sound , as you might imagine , was incredible -- bright and clear.these are fairly pricey , but i am very impressed with the quality . 
good deep tone for my acoustic guitars . 
easily stretched and tuned with no problems . 
you can not go wrong with d'addario strings . 
i 've long been partial to d'addario strings -- i do n't have a guitar without them . 
these phosphor bronze models have found a home on my epiphone flat-top . 
as the package says , they 're warm and bright -- leaning just a little toward the brassy side . 
they project without sounding harsh or tinny . 
playing feel is fairly smooth for round-wound strings and they last for ages . 
this is a good intermediate gauge : light enough for lead work , but substantial enough to provide good backing.guitarists tend to stay loyal to a maker and model of string . 
my loyalty is certainly not shaken . 
for any guitarist on another string whose loyalty might be wavering , these will reward an audition . 
these strings last and they moderated some of the booming i get from other strings . 
i use the exp phosphor bronze on my other dreads . 
these guitar strings sound about the same after a month of playing as they do right after i change them . 
i use to get a real kick out of changing strings because the new strings sounded so much different and better , but now the thrill is gone because these strings sound good for a couple of months although i change once a month anyway . 
i do n't notice much difference at all though.but the best part is that these strings are over $ 17 bucks a set at my local music store and i get 'em for about $ 9.48 through amazon 's subscription service delivered to my mailbox every month with free shipping ! 
beat that ! 
this is the best case ever for the money ! 
i have purchased four other cases and none are as well constructed as the gator deluxe . 
i like this case so much , i plan to purchase two more this week . 
sturdy guitar stand that works equally well for electric or acoustic guitars . 
the stands are well padded where they will touch the guitar , and while the back support would n't scratch a guitar anyway , it 's nice that it lines up perfectly with a strat scratch plate . 
these stands are a lot sturdier than you would think by the picture - mainly because the guitar sits very low . 
this low center of gravity makes it less likely tip when knocked . 
the guitar is at a little more of an angle than i am used to with other stands , but overall this is excellent - i 've replaced all my stands with these . 
well built and solid stand . 
it keeps the guitar well protected and looks nice too . 
some stands hold the guitar with only a hallowed little tube on the bottom , which breaks easily from the weight of the guitar . 
this stand holds the guitar with two solid metal bars , which should last a long time . 
it can hold both acoustic and electric guitars . 
highly recommend it . 
what do you expect for two dollars . 
i use this on a mic stand i got for my rockband mics . 
it took a little bit to shove the mic in and its just plastic , but seriously what do you want for two dollars . 
its solid and it holds a mic , the seller had it to me in a few days before amazon got me my mic stand if your not a serious on stage rockin mother ... . 
you cant go wrong here . 
this is a great cymbal stand sturdy , tight , well made , using it with a 18 &#34; crash and does not move or rattle , amazingly well constructed stand for the price , going to replace my other flimsy stands with a few of these , great product . 
i am not a giging drummer and do not take apart and dismantle the stand at all , but it is a great stand for my studio/practice kit . 
being honest do n't know how it would be for a gigging drummer , but for what i am using it for , more than does the job . 
you can compare this to a pearl or any other popular stand , your just not going to have the pay that hi price try it you 'll like it ! 
this pedal works well , and lets you sculpt a pleasing sound to suit the situation . 
a little goes a long way with the sliders , and the gain and level functions are occasionally useful . 
nice accessory for a tube amp or an amp lacking good onboard eq . 
it makes it much easier to dial in the exact sound you want , easier than messing with eq knobs that can interact with each other.ten bands is a little overkill for guitar . 
three of them are outside the range of the instrument , but i bought this one because i like that it blinks if clipping , it has the extra volume and gain sliders , and comes with the ac adaptor . 
this adds no noise that i can tell , accept if the sliders are up it amplifies noise already there.it 's an all around quality product that i imagine i 'll still have twenty years from now . 
i have a fender hod rod deluxe , and though it 's got the formel electronics mod ... still needed a nice touch.this guy filled the need ! 
using the effects loop , no need of volume or gain , the sound is way much richer and definition for different types of guitars is beautiful . 
i put this on my cheapo $ 300 drumset 's snare , with a remo cs on top , and my snare when from sounding like junk , to sounding great , for a cheap drum . 
this little gadget is perfect if you want to stand back from your mic stand just far enough to make it comfortable to play your guitar while you sing into the mic . 
the usual solution is to get a boom to attach to your stand but this works and it 's simpler , less expensive and takes up less space . 
the pivot is controlled by a friction joint which you can adjust . 
i would n't try to use it if i were a singing drummer , but for a guitarist , it 's great . 
i play guitar and it 's necessary to have the mic angled toward me to sing . 
long boom mics make small stages a bit hazardous to negotiate . 
this little boom gives me a way to get close to my mic without having a long boom cluttering up the stage . 
great product ! 
i bought this when i was doing sound for a party where we had acoustic musicians that wanted to be mic 'd . 
it really came in handy to mic a guitar and a mandolin . . 
i will be buying more of these ! 
i 'm quite happy with any of the `` on stage '' brand stuff i have . 
like i said , this thing is solid , well built , good quality , and they thought of all the little features you need ... jamb nut at the top , little nylon tip on the thumb wheel so you do n't scratch up your post ... just good stuff . 
i 'm used to the mic extension that uses a short gooseneck . 
occassionally there are problems with this set up . 
then i saw these . 
no more bendable problems , i really love these extensions . 
while i do n't have a ton of experience with pedals , i really love this one . 
keeps your guitars tone but you can add some fatness and a mild to fairly substantial crunch and adds some nice sustain . 
although this is a tube-overdrive i actually think it sounds better with my solid state amp . 
it is nothing real drastic but that is exactly what i was looking for , a nice robust boost while keeping your guitar tones integrity . 
for the price i do n't see how you can beat this pedal . 
i also have a digitech jam man and it is awesome . 
no complaints with this outfit . 
if you listen or read what many pro guitarists and techies have to say about digitech effects pedals , they 'll tell you to stay away from them ... accept for this one . 
that 's because the digitech bad monkey tube overdrive is an incredible value that could go head to head with any pedal made by boss or the $ 100 ts-9 tubescreamer.in fact the ts-9 tubescreamer is the pedal the bad monkey is best compared to . 
this is not meant to be a heavy distortion pedal with endless game - it simulates and overloaded tube amp that adds crunch and a little gain to an otherwise clean tone . 
notes will sing and chords will really crunch , especially in blues and classic rock . 
but since the pedal works well as a level/gain boost , i 've heard of guitarists turning on the bad monkey in conjunction with other distortion effects , to really push them to new levels.but the best feature of the bad monkey by far is the two-band eq . 
virtually any distortion pedal has a `` tone '' control that will make the tone darker or brighter . 
but since one band eq basically takes away bass to add treble -lrb- or vice versa -rrb- , you may not find the sound you want . 
that 's what 's so great about the bad monkey - if you feel like your tone is too weak , you can fatten it up . 
if it 's too muddy , you can add treble . 
and you can make those changes without compromising the parts of the tone that you like.construction is extremely durable - die cast metal , and probably heavier than a boss pedal . 
the switch is more similar to a boss than an ibanez pedal , but i find that easier to use.if you 're a beginning player or a player on a budget , this would be an outstanding pedal to own , along with a more traditional high gain distortion pedal . 
there 's really no need to spend the extra money on a tubescreamer , if that will prevent you from buying something else you need for your gear . 
but even for player where money is not an object , do n't overlook the bad monkey . 
it might just be the only tube overdrive pedal you 'll need . 
these do a great job at passively eliminating noise while allowing you to hear your metronome -lrb- or a mix from a soundboard -rrb- perfectly . 
they are certainly worth the price . 
i bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my yamaha motif , simple and easy set up , just plugged it in and it worked fine , no complaints . 
it 's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again . 
well constructed pedal , a nice addition to my recording studio . 
this pedal works with the yamaha motif , that was my main concern when ordering . 
no other review stated that , so i figured i would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering -lrb- i hate returning things ... lol -rrb- , yeah , the strings that it came with were terrible , but it 's an amazing guitar . 
i 'll admit i bought it because it was cheap so i could practice playing on it and not have to worry about it becoming damaged , but it sounds great and plays really well . 
i like how the wood finish is n't all slick , has a nice natural feel to it . 
i 've paid hundreds of dollars more for guitars that did n't sound anywhere near as nice and natural as this one does . 
and , mind you , i have yet to even change the facory strings out ! 
so if you 're looking for a quality guitar at a price that 's more than fair , there simply is n't a better deal around . 
this was my first guitar . 
i 've had it for about 5 or 6 years now . 
my wife bought it at a local `` center '' from the recommendation of one of the teachers . 
i taught myself to play on this . 
first the good : this instrument is a good beginner piece . 
it has a nice full sound and does not take steel fingers to make acceptable sounds . 
the tone is very rich and will having even simple chords sounding great . 
the fit and finish of the piece is amazing for the price . 
it looks great and had no rough or unfinished areas . 
the frets are smooth and finished and the fingerboard feels good . 
tuning is a breeze and this will hold tune very well . 
often only a tweak or 2 before a practice session is all that is needed . 
i have never had it go out of tune while playing -lrb- even when stringbending ! -rrb- 
as you get better the true beauty of this guitar starts to shine . 
it is amazingly playable . 
from simple melodies to serious chord jams this instrument handles it all ! 
the only real compliant i had -lrb- and the reason for the 4 stars -rrb- is the stock strings are n't the best -lrb- imho -rrb- for a beginner . 
i 'm pretty sure they use heavy strings as stock and sure they produce a nice deep rich sound , and wo n't break , they are brutal on new fingers ! 
i would invest in a lighter set and switch them out pretty early on . 
the only other minor quibble is the bridge seems a bit light duty and their is a tendency to get some string slap on the lower strings . 
all in all this is a great deal for the beginner - or even advanced players that just want an extra guitar around to jam on when they do n't feel like dragging out the expensive units -lrb- like playing around a campfire , or outdoors -rrb- if your a beginner just starting out - this is a great route to go as the guitar will continue to give great sounds as you advance ! 
it 's great if you need to quickly drop your hats , but not the other way around . 
i bought this drop clutch because it was cheap , and i was on a budget . 
overall its build is solid , the only problem i have with it is having the clutch lock back into place . 
this drop clutch is just fantastic . . 
i have used them for years and always buy the same model . 
nothing on the market works as well as this . 
simple installation , and it allows you to use your double bass pedals or double kick with a closed hi hat all from tapping it with your drumstick . . 
it could n't be easier . . 
best buy on the market . 
that guitar sounds magically beautiful for guitar of that level and cost . 
it is a great pleasure to jam on it around . 
sound is like it 's real big brother . 
very very familiar.i suppose , it is the best choise for your kid ! 
all hardware is ok . 
just give some days to tuners to get used to ... the build quality could be better - ideally the nut needs to be replaced -lrb- the cut is a rush job -rrb- and the neck needs to be reset -lrb- there 's a gap that indicates that the pocket was n't completely cleaned out when it was put on -rrb- - but what do you expect for this price . 
it is however a playable instrument right out of the box and if you 're willing to invest another $ 50 or so it can be a great starter guitar for a.young -lrb- smaller -rrb- player or a.nice travel instrument . 
i 've been playing over 30 years and got one of these for my 7-year-old because he wants to play guitar like daddy does . 
for $ 100 it 's an ok starter guitar for a kid -lrb- and i guess really short people who ca n't play a regular fender -rrb- , but not something i 'd recommend to anyone else . 
and my kid thinks it looks cool , so he 'll be more likely to stick with it.even though it has a laminated body , the headstock and unfinished neck are decent wood . 
the frets are crowned ok but have some sharp ends to them , and i feel silly investing the cash to have them fixed . 
it 's light and easy to handle . 
the hardware is n't bad , with a stable bridge -lrb- good idea not to put a floating trem in this -rrb- , 5-way blade switch , solid jack and strap anchors , and smooth knobs . 
the pickups are not top notch but work well enough -lrb- a decent replacement set would cost more than the whole guitar does , so i 'm not complaining -rrb- . 
it has a nice red paint job.on the down side , besides some sharp fret ends , it required a few truss rod and bridge adjustments to bring the action close to where it should be . 
the fretboard uses cheap rosewood and in one spot has some extra glue showing around a fret . 
the nut on the one i got is sunk lower on the treble side than on the bass side , so the low e string is farther from the fretboard than the other strings . 
it has one small pit in the red finish . 
it has no paperwork or owner 's manual . 
the tuners are kind of choppy . 
and the body/neck flexes so if you put too much pressure on it the whole thing will go out of tune.it comes strung with fender 9 's , which combined with the short scale makes the strings loose and easy to press down , so it 's good for a kid just starting out . 
i actually enjoy messing around with it because the pickups have a punkish scratchy sound . 
but as soon as he gets bigger we 'll ditch this for something better . 
i got this guitar for my 9 year old son , he loves it . 
this is a buitifull clasic guitar with a good clear sound -lrb- when he is not messing with the knobs -rrb- . 
i would definatly purchase this again . 
to start with , i did n't buy this guitar because it was cheap , but because of the unbelievable reviews . 
i do n't know if they all come out of the box like this one but in the past i have owned and sold my gretch 12 , my yamaha 12 , my ovation 12 , but i wo n't be selling this one . 
i 've had it for 3 months now and have n't adjusted anything , only played this $ 169 12 string from american musical supply / amazon . 
it is the best playing best sounding 12 string i have ever played period ... this guitar set off a couple of other epiphone purchases -lrb- 2 , one for my son -rrb- aj220sce 's and es-339 , also great guitars . 
most of my life epiphones were dull over coated junk , not anymore , and it seems that epiphone is selling cheap to get people to try them . 
i own gibson studio les paul , sg , '87 american strat , martin d35 , washburn rogue , all nice guitars most for a lot more money . 
this guitar is a nobrainer can not believe the value . 
american musical supply is also great , the first aj220sce came in with a bad neck and ams emailed a return fedex lable in an hour and after i dropped it off and it was logged in at a ups outlet around the corner i got an email that the replacement guitar was on the way . 
when it arrived 3 days later it was a good one ! 
:-rrb- -rrb- 5 + star service . 
i wanted a 12 string , but did not want to spend a lot of money , this guitar fits the bill . 
the finish is much darker then the pictures online show . 
great sound from this bad boy . 
this is a big guitar , once i figured out how to tune the 12 string , it really does not go out of tune . . 
after i few hours of play , i retune it and its marginally out of tune , i thought at this price the tuners would be of poor quality , while they are not grover tuners , they get it done.the downside for me is , not the guitar 's fault . . 
this is an inexpensive guitar and a fantastic entry into 12 string playing , this guitar is hard to play below the 15th fret as there is no cut away , but that is true of all guitars using this body type . 
now that i have had it awhile i would love for it to be acoustic/electric but again . . 
for the price , i was expecting an inferior guitar this tool plays great low action . 
im keeping it . 
i knew i did right by buying the dr-212 . 
it 's great and stands up to much more expensive of it 's kind.i have lots of gibsons as well as epiphones and frankly i do n't see any difference to speak of . 
if anybody wants a durable acoustic 12 string with fine sound you 'll find it in the dr-212 . 
best of luck to allregards , roger epiphone dr-212 acoustic guitar , 12-string , natural still using it today , 2 years later . 
easy to install , holds the guitar away from the wall somewhat , and keeps it off of the floor away from the animals when i have it out of the case . 
great find , well worth the purchase price . 
:-rrb- purchased two of these to hang up guitars at home . 
i saw them used in a guitar shop so i assumed they were more than sufficient for use at home . 
i 'm using them with both acoustic and electric guitars . 
they appear to be designed to hang the guitar away from the wall to avoid abrasions on the back and they do just that . 
the hooks can be stretched apart or squeezed together to fit the headstock of the guitar . 
overall , they are attractive , well-made hangars . 
holds my acoustic 6 string great . 
up and out of the reach of a baby just learning to walk , wife also things it looks attractive on the wall as an art piece . 
quality product at a good price . 
solid music stand made of heavy metal poles and solid metal music holder . 
the joints that you tighten are made of a heav plastic material . 
if anything were to give out from use it would be the plastic parts . 
right now in brand new condition everything fits well and grips solidly to hold poles in place . 
arrived a day erly . 
this is a great music stand , i like how it 's adjustable in various ways to customize it to the exact position you need it in . 
it 's very sturdy and well built . 
i do n't ever worry that it 'll tip over . 
i love it . 
i would recommend it . 
solid constructions with enough room for my sheet music . 
very portable , though the holder can be a challenge at times . 
i have another stand that collapses into a very compact unit , but if you have heavy tomes that you wish to use or several sheets that you want to string ... this unit is superior . 
on-stage makes decent products , but this one would have been awesome if the actual table of the stand would fold one or more times . 
that would have been perfect ! 
otherwise , it works fine . 
i 've purchased other types , but i keep coming back to this one . 
for the $ $ it 's the best buy in my opinion . 
these are great strings ! 
break in quickly and hold their tune , work for all styles of playing . 
my go to strings from now on . 
i 've purchased these locally several times over the past three years at a music store . 
mainly due to the low cost . 
they work okay , but are difficult to keep in tune . 
the guitars have to be re-tuned often when temperature , humidity , or playing more than ten minutes occurs . 
my biggest complaint is tarnish and corrosion . 
add that to the winding separating over the fret bars exposing the inner solid string , then the strings go `` flat '' sounding . 
these are not quality strings at all , just cheap chinese made quality . 
they are okay for someone that does n't play often , but if you play daily or as a performer , avoid these strings . 
better strings are worth the extra cost . 
you actually save money by not having to replace them often as you do with these cheap strings . 
i 've had this problem with all the d'addario brand strings , both for electric or acoustic , 6 or 12 string guitars . 
the thinner gauge strings will break during tuning or playing . 
the tarnish and corrosion often ends up contaminating the fret bars and keeping the neck dirty all the time . 
cleaning after each playing session only makes the strings corrode faster . 
i have been using d'adario strings for 30 years . 
they sound great . 
they stay in tune . 
excellent sustain . 
i can get better string control compared to other strings . 
i have never experienced a string break in 30 years . 
what can you say about the best of the best . 
i would n't use anything else on my guitar to get the best tonal quality from it . 
these strings seem to last longer than the others i 've used . 
i highly recommend them . 
my strat has bigger frets than any guitar i have ever owned , and i have a tendency to sharp notes played on thinner gauges , particularly on the 3rd string . 
this 11 to 49 set feels more like my acoustic guitars and minimizes the problem of sharp notes from too much finger pressure , while still feeling `` faster '' than an acoustic guitar . 
they sound great , last a long time , stay in tune and are a good compromise between very light gauges and the really heavy sets . 
i read all of the reviews and bought 6 pairs of these based on the reviews.so , i put these on my gibson les paul last night and played for a few hours . 
i did n't hammer the strings , just played easy , mostly the eagles.as i was hanging the guitar on the wall afterward , i took a quick look at the strings . 
i was shocked to see the high e and b strings were already flattened . 
i never would have expected wear after just a few hours of light playing.the strings sounded great , but by the time i had them stretched enough that they would hold tune , they were already worn.i guess i 'm going to have to go to heavier strings so i 'm not changing strings every few days . 
these just did not perform as expected.giving these 3 stars is being generous . 
i have 5 sets to use up now , damn . 
i was using light gauge and thought these mediums would hold up , but they lasted for only two hours ... my fender 3250l bullets at least lasted a few weeks . 
going to try the fender on my gibson and see how they sound . 
i 'm still in search of the `` perfect '' set of strings . 
i 'm open to suggestions some say `` daw-dare-e-o '' , `` de-ah-dare-e-o '' , `` dad-ar-ee-oh '' , or `` dee-ah-dare-e-o `` others shorten it to `` d-adds '' or even `` daddy-o 's '' . 
took me a while to figure that last one out.i was trying to find out info about `` daddy-o strings '' and why people thought they were so great . 
duh.while people may disagree on how to say the name , few debate the idea that these are great strings . 
* less expensive that most string sets out there , especially if you buy multi-packs * color-coded to make string changes easy * easy to find from most any vendor or music store * made in the usa * you can collect `` players points '' for swag * they are sealed in a special `` environmentally friendly '' package to keep them fresh and corrosion-free * they have one of the widest range of string-size combinations availableif you are just starting out and do not know what to put on your new guitar then the phrase `` set it up with exl-120s '' or `` put on some da-dairy-o '' nines '' is a good choice , at least for a strat or tele-like guitar.i personally like them better than ernie ball super slinkys aka `` eb pinks '' , but i can not quite put my finger on `` why '' . 
you can pay more for coated strings , cryogenic frozen strings , boutique strings , and all that but if you do not know what any of those are then you probably have n't been playing long enough to find value in them.almost every guitarist has a set of strings they `` swear by '' because they work wonders that no other string can - they make them play smoother or faster , their last set of strings lasted for 6 years , or whatever.i just appreciate a great value , and d'addario strings are just that.btw , for the record the official pronunciation is `` da-dairy-o '' : >> `` we receive letters each week regarding the correct pronunciation of the d'addario name . 
some years back , we even ran an ad that illustrated an easy way to pronounce the d'addario name . 
the name is pronounced phonetically as follows : da-dairy-o . 
a simple way to pronounce the most difficult name in musical accessories ! '' 
i 'm just starting out on the electric guitar and was told these were the best . 
i like the light strings because they are kinder to my fingers and they still have a decent sound . 
the price is right . 
these are a great alternative to phosphor bronze transatlantic cables for acoustic guitar ! 
i would rather concentrate on making music . 
why fight your guitar ? 
i ended up settling on these as being my favorite strings years ago . 
ultimately , they 're simply the best for the money . 
you can get them for less than $ 3 per pack , if you shop around . 
as i stated about some other guitar strings i purchased here , these d'addarios for my electric guitar give me the sound , service and price point i need ! 
great strings , and they last well ! 
i 've never had a problem with these and i 'm glad i can get them on here for a decent price . 
i 've been using d'addario xl strings since the 80s . 
i love 'em . 
the 10 pack price is amazing . 
the best strings i ever bought and i 've bought them all . 
i got these for my electric and the ej26-10p acoustic electric for my acoustic . 
they have a really full sound , bright highs , and they bend like crazy . 
folks , i 've tried them all from dean markley to ernie ball . 
all have their good and bad points . 
but after 22 years of guitar playing , d'addario still makes the best electric guitar strings for my money . 
although i prefer the super light top , regular bottom version , i have always loved the feel , tone and durability of d'addario strings . 
the price was most definately the main draw , i am very glad that i placed the order , these people are pleasant to work with !!!!! i 've been using these strings on my guitars for the last 30 + years . 
they always give me consistent results . 
i consider them one of the greatest bargains out there . 
i did n't give 5 stars just because i know there are better strings out there , but these strings are a great value and would n't hesitate to buy them again . 
in fact , i have already bought them several times . 
one little thing i appreciate about these strings is the different colored ends that makes them easy to identify . 
como siempre esta marca con sus productos de calidad es un producto 100 % recomendado por mi ! 
es superrr bueno !! 
ok these d'addario strings are great ! 
i am currently using them on my epiphone sheraton and compared to the fender bullets i had been using , these stay more uniform in tone throughout their life . 
intonation is good and i 've noticed less breakage as well.these strings are a bit bright but have plenty of ` good ' sparkle too and really sound good on my strat , even more so than my sheraton . 
being from the ` old school ' i still much prefer strings to be packaged individually in paper , but what can ya do ? 
besides that , i am totally stoked and happy with these . 
i think i might try 9 's on the sheraton but even as is they play -lrb- and sound -rrb- very good . 
i 've tried just about every make of round wound electric guitar strings in the last 30-40 years , and i 've settled on d'addarios for all my guitars . 
their strings are of uniformly high quality and excellent consistency , the price is right , they 're color coded to make string changing easier , and they come in an air tight plastic package that keeps them from corroding even after sitting in a guitar case or a year or more . 
the 10s are my choice for rock and blues . 
fits very well on my les paul 100 i replaced the factory strings on mydean playmate avalanche junior solid body electric guitar , metallic silver , 3/4 sizeand what a difference in sound . 
these strings seriously rock . 
i also use d'addario strings on my ukulele and i 've had great luck with those . 
they withstand a lot of play and i do n't have to replace them often . 
the best part is , the sound is so much brighter and louder . 
definitely recommended . 
tough to even strech this into a full review ... this is a no brainer ! 
great strings , an industry standard at a great price , what 's nor to love ?!? i have been a faithful user of d'addario strings since a well meaning obsession-starter recommended them to me at a local music store . 
compared to other brands of nickel strings that i 've used , these ones just feel `` cleaner '' than the others . 
they have a clearer sound , and seem to hold their tune better than most.if you 're looking for acoustic strings , you ca n't beat the phosphorus bronze for warmth and clarity . 
but if you 're looking for electrics that are reasonably priced and sound clean , look no further . 
i 've been using the d'addario strings for about 10 years now ... us steel , us made and private labels provider for many other brands of strings . 
-lrb- in other words many other flashy string package companies are just the middleman between you and the best strings ... little known fact in the industry -rrb- their tone and longevityrivals any other string in the industry . 
after 40plus years of playing , d'addario rocks . 
i love these strings and the price too since i like to change them every time i do a modification to my guitars . 
every couple months i change something making `` upgrades '' . 
they sound great and stay in tune well . 
these daddario exl110 strings are light , responsive and make my gibson guitar sound great . 
they work great . 
why use anything else ? 
i 've been playing for 8 years and i own 4 electric guitars . 
all of my guitars are strung with d'addario 10 's . 
they sound great when they 're fresh and in my opinion they stay fresh the longest . 
i play at least 15-20 hours per week so i put a decent amount of wear and tear on my strings . 
it 's really the durability that sets these apart.the amazon price is terrific . 
i like to restring my main guitar a little bit more than once a month and i can buy a year 's worth of these for the same price as 1 set of bass strings . 
i 'd definitely recommend these strings and recommend purchasing through amazon . 
love these strings . 
great for bending and awesome sound . 
i do n't change strings nearly often enough but with a three pack i can rest assure that i always have a back up set just in case . 
after tons of experimenting , i settled on the exl116 for d standard and e flat standard . 
i 've tried 10-52 but the top is a little too floppy for d and that makes notes sound out of tune if you do n't press the string just right . 
also tried 11-56 and while that gives a real solid and full rhythm tone , the attack is too rounded due to the pick taking longer to travel over a wider string . 
that reduces articulation . 
so while you get a fuller sound with the 56 , you get more dynamics and attack with the 52 , and the latter makes metal rhythms sound heavier . 
you can eq fullness into a rhythm track , but you ca n't add in pick attack and greater dynamics.tension wise , at d standard 11-56 is ideal but 11-52 is doable . 
sound wise , 11-52 has been best for my metal recordings and that 's why i 'm sticking with the exl116 set from now on . 
i also replaced the g string with a 20 gauge wound for better sounding power chords . 
and compared to ernie balls , d'addarios start off less bright but maintain their brightness longer , thus a more even and predictable response over time . 
i use these light guage strings because i have arthritis . 
makes a big difference in how easy it is to play the guitar again . 
and if you buy them in a 10 pack , you save a bunch of money ! 
i 've only been in broadcasting for 3 years professionally and i have to say , after researching condenser microphones for several months , countless reviews and spec research i can honestly say , this mic compares and indeed exceeds many microphones costing hundreds of dollars more.here 's another interesting fact . 
i thought the &#34; king of all media &#34; , howard stern would have used some gold plated 10 thousand dollar anniversary rig ... well i found out he uses a 990 as well . 
so , think about it , perfect for the amateur , perfect for the professional ... and under 100 dollars ? 
incredible ! 
you wo n't be disappointed on this buy . 
this is one of the best mics in this price range . 
it sounds incredible , and at this price it 's unbeatable . 
i only use three mics , and this is my main vocal , drum overhead , and acoustic guitar mic -lrb- although i use two mics on the guitar -rrb- . 
my other mic 's are a sm57 , which is incredible and not crazy expensive , and an audio-technica instrument/vocal mic . 
i love this mic and would replace if it ever breaks . 
everyone has there opinions . 
i was told these were great strings by some and others tell me the quality control has slipped after the passing of john . 
what i can say is the strings go on really brassy bright for a few days . 
they slowly mellow out and seem to last a long time . 
sound really nice on my taylor 410ce . 
i bought these strings after they were suggested by a customer at a local shop . 
i play a cigar box guitar and stay with uncoated strings to get a traditional sound from the piezo pickup . 
this is my first set and i am impressed . 
these are not the most flexible strings as another reviewer mentioned , but seem to work well for three string chords and sound good through both a tube and acoustic amp.i would purchase these again for my needs . 
previously i have used ernie ball earthwoods which were more flexible in light form , but great also . 
it would be a toss up for me between the two , but i do know these sound alot better than the basic matin sp strings i tried previously . 
very happy with my new peg winder , feels very ergonomic , works well and is nice to use , thanks for the prompt service and good price ... . 
cheers !! 
it works for what it is , it just feels a little light when you wind after getting the tension up . 
not a bad product , just do n't know how long it will last . 
stable and precise pick attack . 
excellent choice for the aggressive guitar player . 
i am buying more gauges too . 
they last forever . 
these picks work well and look as pictured . 
the shade of pink is very close to that in the picture . 
i would recommend them . 
i ordered 5 different kind of picks and these were my favorite picks . 
they have a very comfortable feel and great sound ! 
this headstand works like a charm . 
it 's simple , portable , and sturdy . 
p.s. to the people complaining about it falling over ... i have no idea what you 're doing with your guitars , but mine is very stable . 
plus all headstands are a bit wobbly and i 've used just about every brand . 
for the price , you ca n't complain . 
this device is ok . 
it is light weight and folds nicely , but it is not especially stable . 
convenient storage is its biggest plus . 
works great for changing out the strings on ones guitar . 
compact enough that it 's able to be stored in your case if you want or if you have a tech box that you bring with you . 
this is a needed tool when changing strings on guitars especially if you change your stringws often as i do . 
i 've tried other types including those that i made myself but i much prefer this one . 
i find it ight and solid and cradels well the nect of any of my guitars ... from fender , takamine , ovations ... etc. . 
for the cost it is worth it and can easily take it with you in your guitar case when travelling . 
highly recommended . 
sweet little neck stand . 
very light weight . 
folds compact to fit in your guitar 's hard case or gig bag . 
padded to protect guitar neck . 
this was very convenient , easy to use , weighs next to nothing and takes even less space than i had expected . 
recommended . 
i do all my own guitar maintenance , which means that my guitars have to lie on the bench with the neck elevated for me to change strings , etc. . 
i had been using a roll of paper towels for that purpose , but the cardboard tube inside would flatten and cause the headstock to hit the bench . 
so , looking around on amazon , i found this handy little device . 
it 's small , works well , and fairly inexpensive . 
my only quibble is that it could be a little bit more robust . 
perhaps if it were made of metal covered in soft plastic instead of the all-plastic construction . 
but do n't get me wrong , it 's still pretty strong ... just do n't put too much weight on it while using it . 
this little geegaw is a stable tripod stand to hold the neck of your guitar while you restring it or perform other work . 
it folds into a nice small package you can store in the gear compartment of most cases . 
the rubber pads on the neck end prevent scratches and the feet keep it in place on the table . 
it may be best to invest in a non slip pad to place under the heel of the guitar body for protection and to prevent it from slipping around as movement can topple the stand if you 're not careful . 
sure , a suitably sized cardboard box or stack of books will also serve that purpose , but what else would you spend the $ 10 on ? 
i started playing mandolin back in september and bought a lot of different picks to try to find the type that would work best for my playing , and finally decided on the dunlop jazz stubby 3.00 mm picks . 
once i determined that it was the best pick for me it was an easy decision to buy a package of them so that i wo n't ever be without one . 
picks have a habit of disappearing just when you need them most -- buying them in bulk this way means that i 'll always have them available and can even share them with others if the opportunity arises . 
this pick is so good to play electric guitar ! 
it is heavy and small , what gave us attack . 
make the sound clean and bright . 
i 've tried every standard pick - even bone , silver & really expensive ones . 
these little dunlop stubby jazz picks are my favorite - and they 're cheap ! 
great on guitar and also * awesome * on mandolin . 
they are small , which takes getting used to , though.play with the round side for a fat tone . 
play with the pointy end for a little better control with only slightly thinner tone . 
i bought these thinking they were the normal sized big stubby picks , obviously they were n't . 
they 're as sturdy as the big ones just a bit too small to be comfortable for me . 
i still think amazon or whoever else could have been a bit clearer with the product information , but it 's still not too bad . 
this guitar hanger is good looking , well made , and was exactly what we were looking for to hang my son 's acoustic guitar on the wall in his room . 
our logic was that having it hanging in plain sight would be much more conducive to him practicing over having it hidden in case stuffed in a closet , and so far that seems to be the case.the hanger was easy to install -lrb- literally took less than 5 minutes to screw into the wall -rrb- and is easy to use -lrb- just place guitar in the padded holder by the neck -rrb- . 
highly recommended!cfh i like to display my guitars while also keeping them safe . 
i bought 2 of these and have had them for a year now and they have yet to let me down . 
my daughter still gets to them and tries to pull them off but she has yet to succeed . 
very solid constriction . 
i like that they pivot so if my daughter pulls them to the left or the right , the piece moves with it and returns it back to balance once she is finished . 
excellent design . 
with musical instruments standing about on my office floor , i determined to find a better way to keep them available , and so i decided to hang them on the walls . 
this hanger was very easy to install . 
it comes with screws and anchors so that it can be attached to drywall itself , or through drywall and into wall studs . 
i used the pre-drilled holes as a template to mark my wall and the hanger went in easily . 
but a word of warning : use a level to align the hanger to a vertical position on your wall . 
if you do n't , your guitar will hang a bit cock-eyed . 
these hangers work great but make sure you purchase some spare screws . 
the screws provided easily break when screwing into a stud so i would recommend you buy some good screws before you install . 
i have several of these and at least three screws broke as i screwed them into the stud in the wall . 
i bought this one as a way to save space in my overstuffed room . 
it looks really good , almost like an ornament . 
it sturdy and good quality . 
5 stars . 
this is a lovely wall mount for your guitar . 
comes with everything you need -lrb- accept a drill or a screwdriver of course -rrb- . 
it is pretty and very strong . 
i originally purchased it to hang on drywall -lrb- sheetrock -rrb- for my 5 year old 's mini guitar but once i had it mounted i found that it is strong enough to hold my electric guitar , which is quite heavy and that is amazing to me because usually that kind of weight would pull a mount right out of the sheetrock . 
this is a good buy . 
this design is a big improvement over string swings ' past designs head stock fits snugly in the well made cradle . 
quality wood constructtion and the rubber material used feels nice to the touch . 
i will buy more if i get another guitar . 
i have been fortunate to build a small , but decent collection of acoustic and electric guitars in a room dedicated to music . 
all 15 of my guitars are hanging on the walls and in the 15 years i 've been using string swings i 've never had a problem with them . 
they hold every guitar , regardless of neck shape or style . 
since they swivel , my fender necks are just as secure as my gibson necks . 
the depth is adjustable , so they will account for the difference between acoustic guitars and solid body electrics . 
while i never had a problem with the rubber grip on the hangers marring the finish of my nitro coated guitars , i did n't want to take a chance , so i use self-adhesive sheets of felt and wrap the posts with felt to further protect the guitar 's finish . 
i try and screw them into studs to support the weight , and where i ca n't do it , i hang some of my lighter guitars , but the anchors that come with the hangers are strong and secure ... although i sprung a couple bucks and bought similar screw-in anchors ; but made out of metal - just that added bit of security to make sure nothing happens . 
i also strongly recommend -lrb- as others have done -rrb- that you run a humidifier in the room housing your guitars -lrb- 40-50 % humidity is perfect -rrb- . 
i recommend the honeywellhoneywell hcm-6009 quietcare 9-gallon output console humidifier with air washing technology i might have done something wrong ... i read in a review that these hold six picks.it held three real well but on the fourth insert the thing just fell apart ... i 'll just keep using my pockets . 
this product works just fine . . 
spring loaded ... so load the picks up ... wish they would hold a couple more ... but im happy ... i keep in guitar case and very handy to have ... enjoy man , this thing would not even hold my normal sized picks ! 
do not buy - it is a wast of money ... ug ! 
this dunlop `` ergo pickholder '' is so convenient for storing picks directly on the guitar . 
this is a great way to always have picks handy , especially if you drop one while playing . 
here are my observations : + small size ; is fairly unobtrusive when mounted to the guitar + easy to attach ; just peel of the paper backing and stick it where needed + good capacity ; easily holds 6 picksmy only note of caution is that if you overload this and then fumble pulling out a pick , you are likely to get more then one dispensed in your hand . 
try it once or twice and it is easy to avoid.recommendedcfh does what it says ! 
i live the rounded edges and more streamlined apperance , it dosnt jump out and scream look what someone stuck to this fine guiitar , like some of the brightly colored plastic ones on the market seem to do , this is obviously higher quality . 
well made , a nice spring inside its practically invisible but there to slip out a pick on the fly whenever you need one ! 
i quess this pic holder may be a pretty good idea but just not something i would use but as i said , it 's ok . 
nice , holds picks better then my old one , and best of all ... it comes with one free disintegrating pick ! 
it is really awesome , all you have to do is alt-pick in 16th , and watch it dissapear before your very eyes ! 
lol , great product though . 
i ca n't compare this product to any others because this is the only pick holder i use . 
i have bought dozens of these over the years and have one on every guitar i own . 
and every student i 've ever had , has one on their guitar as well . 
they are very strong and the adhesive is outstanding . 
they stay in place for as long as you want them to and at the same time , they can be easily removed and relocated . 
after relocation they are just as sturdy in the next location as they were in the prior location . 
i have had as many as 12 picks stored in one and as few as one pick stored in others . 
no matter how many picks you store , or for how long , the spring action loader never loses its resistance . 
i highly recommend these . 
i personally will never even try any others as i am so pleased with this product . 
if you or a student of yours tend to drop a lot of picks , this is the product for you . 
attach one of these to your guitar with the included adhesive strip , and you 'll always have a spare pick at the ready . 
had no issues in the 2 months . 
there is a red pick that is supposed to say inside under your ` real ' picks , which helps with its looks . 
my picks fall out way too easy while i 'm playing live i lose picks constantly . 
years ago i resorted to placing them between the srings in the neck of the guitar when im not playing it . 
that of course leads to bent picks and still , lost picks . 
this thing is great . 
i load it up with alternating -lrb- hard and soft -rrb- picks so i can easily swap out between songs . 
best $ 3 i 've ever spent . 
i 've used several different kinds of guitar cables , and i 've finally settled on planet waves cables . 
from patch cables to guitar cables , i simply trust this company . 
in most cases the difference between guitar cables is the same difference between an iphone and an android , there really is n't one - it simply comes down to user prefrence . 
so in that regard , i prefer planet waves cables . 
i snagged this cable so i had the one right angle for my pedal board and the other end for my guitar . 
highly recommended ! 
it has what you want in a cable , and not what you do n't . 
not insanely priced from having pixie gold dust sprinkled over it , but quiet and supple and uses good quality plugs on both ends . 
so there it is ; nothing magical , just a guitar cable . 
no problems at all with this product . 
works well with the five string bass and amp purchased from amazon . 
i would recommend this product . 
second one i bought . 
lousy build quality and only lasted 3 months . 
went through two of these before i learned my lesson . 
do n't waste your money on this junk . 
i love planet waves stuff normally , but these are junk . 
i got a couple of these ... only buy this cable if there is no chance that it will be ever used in the real world ... after only a month mine has developed a nasty short in the plug ... and of course , since this cord is molded/sealed up tight , it ca n't be repaired ... you could cut off the plug and solder a good 1/4 inch plug on it ... but why bother . ? 
... just save your headaches and money and buy a good heavy duty cord ... this cord is too flimsy ... its junk with a fancy molded plastic ergonomic looking plug housing ... but inside its junk ... thrown away money . !!! 
... buy a lottery scratch off instead , , , i wanted something inexpensive and well made and decided to go with planet waves over the similarly priced fender cable . 
i like it because the tip is one piece instead of screw on and the price was just right . 
when i have to replace this cable i will likely buy this same cable or something else by pw because of all the cables i have owned pw seems to withstand my abuse most effectively . 
i own several of these cables in various lengths and am very pleased with the quality and performance of them . 
i use this particular length cable for patching various pieces of audio gear in a rehearsal space or for plugging into a direct box on stage.the ends are solid when connected and the cable material itself is very ` slinky ' , i.e. not stiff or difficult to work with like some other cables tend to be.and a lifetime warranty on the cables is a great addition at this price . 
i love the fit and the sound quality . 
it does n't come loose or wiggle once in place . 
i 'll get this one again ! 
a good cable for the money . 
could have better stress release , but certainly plenty good enough for normal use and a very good value . 
well this cable certainly did n't last long as the title says 8 weeks . 
bought a new fender mustang2 v2 amp a week and a half ago . 
last night amp would turn on but was n't putting out any sound from the guitar . 
messed around a bit and it started to work . 
today same thing and it 's obvious nothing is going from guitar to amp . 
thought i had a bad jack in my new amp and was n't very happy . 
got out the old amp and guess what nothing there either . 
at least my new amp is working and i only have to replace a $ 12 cord.maybe i 'm just unlucky and got a bad one and if i bought it at a local store i 'd return it . 
not going through the hassles of mailing it back or asking for a refund . 
will just move on to another company 's cord . 
it came in nice packaging.cable looks great - feels of high quality.so far it still works well .10 ft is nice for home.if you 're a performer ... longer is required . 
quiet and durable firm picking surface but flexible body so feels a bit more natural than a rigid pick . 
they are slightly larger than a normal dunlop pick but much the contoured body makes it much easier easy to hold , i can play all night without dropping it . 
these look so neat that my brother and i both unknowingly ordered these for each other as gifts last christmas . 
unfortunately they feel too chunky to use and the colored tip grips the strings in an unfortunate way making it difficult to play . 
i love dunlop straps because i 'm a tall guy and they 're long enough for me not to look like an electric-guitar-playing-mariachi . 
i ca n't remember how many years ago i started using this great stuff . 
like everything else , moderation is the key and having good clean neck and strings is where it all starts , but a quick spray and a wipedown with a lint free cloth does wonders before every time i play ! 
apprehensive in buying let alone using but glad i did . 
not an everyday product - but when your strings still have their tone but have lost a bit of their glassy feel ... start to feel scratchy , this is a quick fix until you 're ready to re-string . 
i 've been using this product for years now and it is truly outstanding . 
it provides a terrific slick feel to the fretboard and makes playing much easier and more enjoyable . 
clean , no residue from repeated use , and the glide across the strings is super nice . 
i use it regularly on my usa stratocaster maple neck and would n't leave home without it . 
works as advertised . 
i was a bit skeptical when the product arrived , but i just set up my acoustic guitar with this product and it does work . 
pretty simple , even if you 're `` technically challenged . '' 
easy to use . 
have n't gigged with it yet , but i can imagine that this strap `` is n't going anywhere , '' regarding its functionality . 
not a `` pretty '' product , but good stuff . 
my new guitar had only the back strap connector.you can put out over $ 20 for a button strap holder but for under 5 bucks i decided on this.attach short end to strap feed long end under strings on guitar head.you now have a quick release strap holder.very well made & strong !! 
happy i found this before spending way more than i needed to !! 
highly recommend this product !! 
joe using on a yamaha dreadnought acoustic . 
goes one easy , and feels sturdy . 
thinking about ordering another for an acoustic electric.update 8-2-12 : ordered another for my seagull acoustic electric . 
like the first one , works great . 
came on time . 
work great for my needs . 
geart for set-ups and take-downs . 
does lengthen the strap a bit but works . 
this is a handy little contraption . 
i 'm using on one of my cheaper guitars . 
it was n't compatible with the other strap i 've been using and i had a difficult time getting it to secure to my strap , but it worked well with the strap on my other guitar.i think it 's a good idea and practical for being on the stage and switching instruments quickly . 
this is a convenient way to keep your picks close in case you drop one or need to chance to different pick weight . 
i do n't have a bass , however , it fits great on my acoustical and electric guitar . 
if you 're a bass player and use a pick , you need one of these . 
if you are a bass player and * sometimes * use a pick , you * really * need one of these ! 
i bought one for every bass and a spare.wedgies work better on bass than guitar , because the strings are thicker and usually parallel . 
i have a guitar wedgie on my gibson explorer , and it is a bit loose because of the angled headstock spreading the strings -- but the bass ones stay put.really , these things are great . 
after reading some poor reviews for goosenecks of 19 &#34; or more , i decided to play it safe with a couple of 13 &#34; gooseneck = - this way , if a longer unit is needed , i can just screw 2 together . 
this is an excellent piece of hardware , very stiff and sturdy with no droop or sag . 
even when i put 2 together to come over the top of my guitar amp so i could mic it from the front , using an sm 57 , and this gooseneck holds the mic absolutely still.great buy . 
i use the gooseneck to position my pop filter over my microphone . 
it is also sturdy enough to use on my microphone holder to hold my microphone in place . 
we added this as an extension to our clubhouse pa system . 
it 's very nice quality has a range of easily adjustable stops and provided excellent ability for both short and tall speakers absolutely obligatory for any fan of rock n roll jamming with tastes of jazz influenced rock -- 1970 's influences . 
i would probably buy the phase 100 today though , as it has 4 different positions to choose from , i assume including the original set-up as one of them.well , i need to correct this . 
this review was for the old models . 
the new models have far too high midrange and the components are no longer easily modified . 
i thought i was replacing an old model with the new one , but alas the new is not worthy of a place in my effects chain!i will probably get an eh small stone now , though that pedal looks like it may have been changed lately too . 
sadly it appears boutiques are being bought by non-musical business men who care only about the bottom line and not enough , if at all about the sound/quality of their products . 
the capitalists have become too greedy , and the socialists think they are worthy to tell everyone else how to live . 
god help us ! 
good cheap mic cover , fits es-57 ok , could be a bit tighter i suppose . 
anyway it only needs to keep goobies from getting in my mic ! 
nice cover for my behringer xm8500 . 
it is fitted snugly and well made . 
the color is nice and bright . 
i wanted to have other colors but this is only available in red and black also . 
i do not have much to say about this . 
it does what it was designed to do and it looks fine.i found myself actually trying to see if it will rip , for the purposes of this review . 
just so i could make some sort of comment about it ... you can rip it if you try , but it 's not likely to happen during everyday use.it 's fairly thick . 
if that is n't what you want then i would look elsewhere . 
this should be fine for nearly everyone who does n't have a very specific reason for a different sort of windscreen . 
it works well , has n't broken down -lrb- despite much abuse -rrb- , and can easily be cleaned . 
now if only all windscreen 's were this sturdy , i 'd be a happy customer . 
at first i thought this would be a gimmick , but it was cheap so i figured what the hell . 
once i had it , however , i realized how invaluable it was . 
when performing live , i always had to make sure to stand the exact same distance away from the mic of the volume would change based on my distance from the mic . 
once i got this little guy though , i just sing right into it and even press my mouth up against it at times . 
volume remains constant , white noise is gone and the sound is crystal clear . 
it also protected my mic in a fall once too . 
can find anything better for this cheap . 
i bought this to keep the saliva on the mic to a minimum . 
should work just fine . 
i also bought the green one . 
i have been using these simple windscreens for years and they always perform great . . 
escpecially for the money . . 
i would recommend this to anyone . 
i definately helps cut down &#34; wind whistle &#34; on my mic . 
ca n't say anything great about the product but i cant say anything bad . 
it does what it is suppose to works just as it should , love it and a great price to boot if you have several different people on the same mic you should buy a stock of these . 
they are well made and do work . 
i would buy them again . 
i bought these to fit my two microphones - they snuggly hold shure sm57 and sm58 . 
however , my two mics came with shure clips -lrb- to my surprise -rrb- . 
these clips are 1/16 in . 
from front to back . 
in comparison , the shure clips are 1/4 in . 
to 1/8 in . 
from front to back . 
so , the shure clips are more sturdily built , but both seem to hold the mics well . 
the pinstripe heads are amazing . 
i will buying them for life , they are very durable and sound great . 
the emperor x snare head on the other hand is junk . 
it makes my snare sound like a high tom almost , hate it . 
very durable and they sound amazing , i love these drum heads and would recommend them to anyone that needs drumheads i bought these heads almost a year ago and after countless band practices and gigs , the same heads i bought over a year ago are still sounding great and have n't torn . 
these heads are amazing and a very good investment . 
make your kit sound very professional and i just love em to death . 
definitely recommend these heads to people looking for new heads this was the easiest way to hook up my pedals without having long wires all over the floor to trip on . 
it 's easy and convenient to use without losing quality and getting feedback loops . 
i recommend it to all aspiring musicians . 
works as described . 
solid little wires that allow you to be creative in how you hook up your guitar pedals ... may work other applications that require the same type of plug . 
this is a great affect . 
awesome engineering as jim dunlop 's mxr products has always presented . 
the true bypass feature and the high-end quality materials make it very reliable and dependable . 
eq is very sensitive and delivers as it should . 
i actually believe this will exceed all your expectations . 
ships fast . 
highly recommended . 
this little box will give it to you . 
i personally play bass and i have a thing for long affect chains . 
i count in my little arsenal with fuzz , distorions , auto wah , a compressor , octaver , bass booster and a nice di box . 
the mxr eq helps me a great deal to `` recuperate '' definition and clarity after this long affect chains that i love . 
a great little box.so if you are looking for clarity , definition and even a little extra punch for your sound the mxr eq will do the trick.cheers !!! 
i have played the guitar for nearly 50 years now , and wanted an inexpensive small-body steel-string guitar to keep out for informal practice and noodling . 
this one fills the bill pretty well . 
build quality is quite good -lrb- made in indonesia , not china as i had expected -rrb- , and the intonation is perfect . 
the finish has a hard matte surface that will probably wear well . 
a pick guard is present , but when i removed the plastic shipping protector , the entire guard came up with it . 
the adhesive residue comes right off , so i will play the guitar without a pickguard . 
bracing is light -- the entire guitar is light . 
the body is a bit larger in the lower bout than i expected , but it sits on the lap more comfortably than a dreadnought.i take issue with some reviewers ' suggestions that this would be a good beginner guitar right out of the box . 
the string spacing at the nut is narrower than it should be for the width of the neck , cramping the fingers . 
the nut should be replaced with one that spaces the strings across the fingerboard just a little more . 
the action may be lowered by shaving the bridge saddle very carefully , and just a little at a time . 
this work will cost as much as the guitar cost if you take it to a luthier , but if you can do it yourself , will improve the playability of the instrument.the strings supplied on the guitar were tinny and cheap , so i replaced them with a set of d'addario ej-16 light phosphor-bronze . 
the improvement in tone was immediate -- this little guitar sounds pretty darn good . 
all in all , with some careful modification , this is a good guitar for the beginner or casual player , and a very acceptable one for the experienced guitarist who can do a little modification him/herself . 
it 's kind of pointless to add yet another review to an item that has already received hundreds of -lrb- mostly -rrb- positive reviews already . 
but i ca n't help it - i like this guitar . 
quite simply , this is a really nice guitar . 
is it $ 750 nice ? 
no . 
but for less than $ 100 , nice does n't even describe it.my jasmine arrived well packaged including double boxing . 
the outside box had a little damage , but the guitar was well protected inside , so no problem.since i 'd read a few reviews commenting on flaws in the finish , one of the first things i did was check it out thoroughly . 
nope , no flaws noticeable to me . 
kind of a satin `` laid back '' finish that feels good and looks nice . 
oh , but i did immediately remove the pick guard . 
it just peeled off without damaging the finish underneath and -lrb- in my opinion -rrb- it looks better without it.other reviews had complained about a too-low action . 
but mine seems dead on . 
of course action height is more a personal preference than any hard and fast rule . 
but even so , there 's really no way anyone could characterize mine as too low.some mentioned rusty strings . 
not on mine . 
the strings looked fine , and after the usual breaking in period have maintained tune very well.and of course the guitar sounds good . 
again , maybe not $ 750 good , but at least $ 250-300 good . 
and certainly better than i expected it to sound at that price.so , if you want a nice sounding , decent looking , inexpensive guitar - you 've found it . 
stop wasting time . 
just click the buy it button . 
i bought my son a thousand dollar epiphone limited edition electric guitar for his birthday just a few months ago , so when he told me he would like an acoustic guitar for christmas , i told him an expensive one was not in our budget.we went to the local music store and tried out several models but he kept coming back to this one . 
the sound was absolutely fabulous , much better than his current acoustic guitar that cost more than twice as much as this one.the store manager told us that for the price this guitar can not be beat and that he bought one for his son as well . 
in my opinion , this was as good as other brands costing three times as much . 
i 'm not sure how takamine is making these quality guitars for so little money , but if you 're looking for a starter guitar , or just looking to add another guitar to your collection , this would make an excellent choice.i inspected the guitar we took home and found a few places where the finish was not quite as smooth as the rest of the guitar , but overall the quality and sound can not be beat for this price.we also went with this cutaway version so my son can have easier access to the higher frets vs. thejasmine by takamine s35 acoustic guitar , natural . 
right out of the box this guitar was flawless . 
i played it with the strings it came with -lrb- to inspect intonation-fret buzz etc. the old strings would work for set-up if needed -rrb- and the intonation -lrb- harmonics at the 12 fret exactly matched the fretted note at the 12th fret -rrb- was dead on . 
absolutely no fret buzz even at the 21st fret . 
i have been playing guitar for 40 years and i have seen my fair share of acoustic guitars in that time . 
to say this is a beautiful playing and sounding instrument just does n't do it justice . 
i have played many expensive acoustic guitars that did n't sound or play as well as this even after set-up . 
the lows are nice and clear and the highs are clear without sounding `` tinny '' or banjo like . 
a very well built , great sounding guitar . 
for the price you ca n't go wrong . 
i would recommend this guitar to novices and pros . 
i was not expecting a guitar of this quality for such a low price . 
100 % satisfied . 
rock on jasmine !! 
a nice little untreated cloth to clean my taylor guitar.now if i could only play the guitar as well as this cloth cleans it . 
; 0 -rrb- very soft gray microfiber cleaning cloth . 
big and wide enough to handle any guitar . 
works great for polishing and buffing guitar finish . 
i bought 3 of these to store in various bass cases . 
i use them after a session or practice along with some guitar cleaner . . 
sadly , i could not find any untreated cloths locally so i had these shipped through prime . 
these cloths are gentle and prevent scratching the finish unlike some of the microfiber types i see here and in stores that tend to leave streaks and in some cases scratches on the guitar . 
this polish cloth is cheap and does the job of wiping your guitar down from dust or from use with cleaning products . 
it does n't scratch the guitar and works great ! 
well it 's a cloth and i use it to wipe my guitar . 
this is a fairly good size cloth at that . 
this is a great-sounding reverb pedal . 
tons of options and ways to manipulate your sound . 
i 've combined this with a epiphone sheraton ii -lrb- semi-hollow body -rrb- and have been able to get some awesome deep , rich sounds -lrb- watch out for feedback though -rrb- . 
the design is very solid , and the controls are quite easy to use . 
honestly , i think it has a lot of reverb settings that i wo n't use very much , but there 's no problem with them being there.i definitely recommend this reverb pedal for fans of kings of leon , u2 , etc. . 
or if you 're just looking for a pedal to boost your sustain and create deeper tones , this is it . 
this has definitely enhanced my creativity with a guitar . 
my only caveat to this review is that i have n't tried out other reverb pedals , but this one definitely suits all my needs . 
as soon as i got this pedal i put it on my board and noticed it had a high end hum . 
i have a 2 behringer pedals on my board and a lot of people say they are bad noisy pedals , but my pedal board was silent till i put this pedal on it . 
i 've only had it for a few days , but the cons out way the pros . 
maybe i will purchase a noise reducer to help clean it up a bit . 
once i get around to playing with it i will write another review . 
if you want to do swells with your instrument , or make notes &#34; cry &#34; , this ' will do the trick . 
smooth , reliable action and no noise too . 
there is no way any kind of rig is complete without at least one of these . 
i have several . 
came in perfect working condition . 
great buy . 
the strap is adjustable on both ends , and the front adjustment slider sat right on my shoulder . 
i cut it off and glued the material back together with shoe-goo , and now it 's great . 
padding and wide material make standing with a heavy bass a whole lot less tiring . 
i got a couple of these to accommodate different strap locks i have on different bass . 
the fact that it is wide is nice . 
as others have said you need to slide the padding down , but you ca n't beat these for the money . 
it 's not fancy , but it 's well though out , and you ca n't beat the value . 
the edges do n't cut your neck , and having adjustments at both ends allows you to adjust it exactly how you want . 
like others , i had to unstitch the pick holder pocket in order to provide a greater range of adjustment . 
the foam position is never a problem as it will slide where you want , and it flexible/thin enough to go through the buckles if needed . 
excellent no frills product with good enough cushioning for a bass . 
serves its purpose ; worked better when i added a quick-disconnect attachment ; quality finish , comfortable , and enough range to adjust as needed ; i am so happy with this product that after buying the first one , i bought two more for my bouzouki and for my octave mandolin . 
produce is great price and good quality . 
it is just the right size to hold my mandolin while i play . 
this strap is not only nice looking and an excellent product . 
well made and sturdy . 
it would be hard to beat . 
other reviewers have mentioned that the slot that goes over the strap peg is tight . 
they are correct , but it stays on like a monkey riding a motorcycle . 
for the bread this is a great strap . 
buy one and see what i mean . 
my uncle played with a couple of old boot laces for a strap back in the day . 
treat yourself and leave your laces in your boot ... it was very hard to get the hole in the strap over the button on my mandolin . 
at least it wo n't fall off soon ! 
i just got another mandolin with no button , and this strap has no way to attach to it . 
at the begining i was n't sure to buy it since there are a lot of reviews out there with negative imputs about this , so i decided to buy it and i started having problems right of the box , i notice this noise coming out of my amp and also a bad performance of my pedals , then i started to play with them and realized that i had too many pedals connected through a daisy chain , so i decided to leave just one connector alone and available and only used 4 with my pedals and surprise ! 
, connected to a power strip it eliminated all the unwanted noise and performance started to work just fine , i also realized that pedals positions -lrb- routing signal -rrb- has something to do with it , i could n't figure out what was it but defenetly works just fine once you got it right , so i would recomend to play a little with your set up and make sure to avoid abuse on it , so it work as it is supposed to . 
i use this at the house for pedal power or for testing new pedals.i do n't use this on my pedal board and do n't know if i would recommend it for heavy live use . 
i suppose having more than one for reliability would be the key here.it does work well and will power many pedals at one time . 
i do not use it for powering only one pedal though . 
this device puts out a lot of juice and will be noisy at times through less expensive pedals.i also like the fact that it only takes one spot on a power strip without covering up a neighboring power outlet.easy to use - it is what it is . 
this plug works very well . 
i like the right angle connectors . 
i have a korg pitchblack plus that can act as a powersource for other pedals . 
it included a multi-plug cable , but not a right angle one . 
the connectors kind of stuck out and got in the way on my pedalboard . 
this works much better . 
this original plug fits the purpose perfectly ! 
quality and precision ! 
the plugs do n't take up space -lrb- could n't be smaller -rrb- and the wiring is pliable and easy to rout in and out of spaces on your pedalboard . 
keep away from the cheap imitations that rob you of space and are hard to work with ! 
make sure what you receive is a one spot product in its original packaging -lrb- check images -rrb- . 
this is a very handy item to have when you need to connect your guitar effects with power . 
its easy to install and keeps things simple . 
no more extra messy cabling . 
glad i got it . 
thanks to amazon for the quick delivery . 
bought this for my guitar pedals and it works great and does n't cost much . 
i just attached it to an existing adapter and voila . 
nice daisy chain , if it 's bought along with the 1 spot adapter , just make sure to avoid using all the connectors , since it could overload the adapter and you 'll have noise problems and performance issues , if you use 4 analog pedals connected -lrb- as i do -rrb- there wo n't be any problem , i had to play around and also realized that some pedals might use little more power on their funtions , so what i do is that i have a 1 spot adapter connected to a power strip with my 3 boss pedals and a wah , and in the other power strip slot i have another generic adapter connected with my mxr noise clamp so it does n't interferes with them . 
i works just fine . 
if you own more than 1 pedal -lrb- and we all do -rrb- you need this and the 1 spot adapter . 
it will save you a lot of money on batteries and aggravation when you battery runs out on stage . 
it 's worth it 's weight in gold . 
and rockisland sound sends it out fast ! . 
you can count on me for future purchases ! 
thanks guys ! 
i started by powering 1 stomp box on this chain and it worked , but when i tried to add a second/third stomp box , i could n't get any guitar sound only a loud buzz . 
i returned this product i did further testing , i would not recommend it to anyone . 
with my personal experience in mind , i would advice you to save your money and get a pedalboard power supply . 
hope this helps if you 're buying this and new to effects pedals -lrb- like i was -rrb- , you 'll be concerned whether it 'll work with the inexpensive pedals you 're likely to also be buying , especially since there is a large kit with a number of converters that might scare you into thinking you 'll need them . 
the two most common types of inexpensive pedals are danelectro and behringer , and if you 're like me they 're ll you 'll buy for quite a while . 
the good news is , you do not need to buy converters for them . 
this little beauty will run all your behringer and danelectro pedals , off from any of the standard 9v power supplies available -lrb- you do n't need to buy a 1spot , i use it with a behringer but you could certainly put it together with the less-expensive planet wave if you 're working on an even tighter budget . 
in short , buy this product , it will save you its cost in 9v batteries within the first two months if you 're on low-price pedals . 
... thing is great for multi-pedal use ! 
this is a must if you have any of the danelectro/fab pedals . 
as anyone who has one of these pedals knows they eat 9-volts like candy , you purchase the power supply -lrb- search for danelectro da-1 9.6 v ac adapter -rrb- and this cable and you 're good to go for up to 5 pedals ! 
no more battery swaps . 
very nice cable . 
i used this with my planet waves 9v adapter . 
it works very well , all my pedals powered off one adapter is very useful . 
the onespot adapter itself would probably be even better as it only takes one place on a power strip etc instead of a chunky old school adapter like the planet waves style . 
really nice product for the price . 
this product is n't really one to review but it does what it advertises . 
i use this in conjugation with a one spot and a boss daisy chain coming from my tu-3 -lrb- great tuner by the way -rrb- . 
starting to build my pedal board so i figured better to start off with a 30 dollar power source than to go and spend like two hundred on a t-rex fuel tank , which i 'm planing on in the future . 
great adapter for all of your pedals , decent quality , and only ten bucks . 
ca n't beat it ! 
every guitar i 've ever cared about has had this strap on it . 
i must 've bought about 10 of these over my lifetime , and i do n't regret it even in the slightest . 
just arrived in good shape . 
polish w / an expansive polishing cloth . 
almost size of a dinner napkin which is nice as opposed to much smaller lens cleaning cloths . 
i have many planet waves cables . 
they are all very well made . 
i like the molded ends that seem to help prevent shorts . 
an excellent value . 
i would highly recommend . 
i have to start off by saying this cable does not produce the same sound quality of my mogami gold cables . 
if you are recording and are going to meticulous about your sound , this might not be the cable for you.however , for the price and purpose this a five star cable . 
the plastic plug ends relieve stress on the connection , but also feel sturdy and secure . 
the gold plating ensures a solid connection.what i like most about this cable is that it 's guaranteed for life and i can bring it to a planet waves authorized dealer for a replacement ... or so their packaging claims . 
i have not had to replace mine . 
i 've been using this one for about a year now , with no problems . 
i really like the durability and clear sound quality . 
i was using the standard version of these , i saw these at amazon and figured i 'd give them a try.these cables are a little more stiff than the standard cables i was using however the ends seem much more well belt.doesn ' t make a difference in the sound ? 
i do n't know but i am satisfied with this purchase . 
this is as light as you want to go on a lp scale length . . 
about the same tension as 9s on a strat.so , do n't want 9s , and 10s too tight then 9.5 s it is . . 
nice strings guitar string 9.5 between 9 and 10 . 
does its job for those who want strings that are easier to bend than 10 and not as noodlely as 9 . 
honestly , the strings are great . 
they sound great and they are -lrb- relatively -rrb- inexpensive for bass strings . 
i love them , and they will be what i buy the next time i change out as well . 
highly recommended . 
i bought a bass from this site , and as much as i love the thing , i 'm not an expert . 
i popped my e string over-tightening it when i was setting it up . 
i replaced the factory strings with these . 
i 'm told it sounds better now . 
i think so as well , but i ca n't quite quantify it . 
i usually use the pro steels -lrb- by d'addario -rrb- but these sound and fit nicely with my squire fender p bass . 
amazon seems to have great prices and it 's nice to have them delivered too . 
i 'm normally an acoustic guitar player but recently acquired my first electric ever . 
it was used , and the strings were dismal sounding , so i bought these d'addario exls . 
they hold pitch beautifully . 
my only complaint has to do with my guitar technique , not the strings . 
having used heavier strings forever on my acoustic guitars , the recommended lighter gauge recommended for the electric do n't like my `` heavy-handed '' approach to pressing down the strings . 
as a result , the highly bendable lighter strings become sharp up near the nut until i relax and enjoy playing with a very light touch . 
it will take some getting used to -- or else i 'll simply move to heavier strings and leave the lighter ones to lead guitarists who know what they are doing . 
all of that said , the strings are pure joy to play . 
i 've used d'addario 's on so many different guitar 's the only opinion i can honestly give ya is that they are the best . 
in the studio or on stage , they stay in tune and work very well with any pickup you are using . 
i put these on my wife 's bass cause she is still learning and with a fender squire it sounds almost as good as a precision fender bass . 
they stay true to the note so she will get to know what the pitch and note should sound like every time ... . 
best articulate bass string for the money . 
i have one of the first versions of the fender precision lyte bass from the 90s . 
i have started to use lighter strings to keep the neck from getting fatigued . 
they sound great and stay in tune . 
sound like rotosounds ... think roger glover , geddy lee , and chris squier . 
nice bright and deep sound with fingers or pick . 
i am not a slap style player so i ca n't comment on that . 
i set my action fairly high to keep every thing clean as possible . 
try them , you 'll like them and your bass guitar neck will be happy . 
i keep going back and forth between dr high beams and these . 
my teacher really likes the high beams , but these are half the price , and the tone is just great and , surely a new set of these are going to have more &#34; oomph &#34; than a set of high beams i keep a little too long because they cost more ... recommended . 
only issue they break easily . 
but they last a long time and sound great . 
well worth the money . 
crisp and fresh tone for a long time . 
d'arrario does sell some fine strings . 
while these are not my very , very favorites -lrb- strictly because i prefer a slightly lighter gauging on light strings -rrb- , they still do just fine -- much better than some other brands i 've tried . 
i would not hesitate to buy them again . 
good-sounding and playing all-around strings . 
bought these to try them out the medium gauge and brand . 
mediums too hard on my thin fingers and will stick to light and extra light gauges . 
the strings were hard to slide , un-slippery , and changing barr chords made so much squeaks i did n't like . 
tone is warm but too mellow for my tastes . 
g-string snapped 2 days later at the windings with the string wounds pried right off :\ i 'm new to acoustic so i 'm not too sure how things go , but from what i have learned from using these pics is that they seem pretty good . 
a little to thick for my style though . 
they make a very deep and loud noise . 
i prefer placing electric strings on acoustic . 
they sound much better and are n't quite as loud . 
these are my go-to acoustic strings . 
they are a quality string with great sustain and clarity . 
i bought elixir nanos to compare , and i did like them , but i think you get more clarity when chording or hammering on with these . 
i 'll be sticking with these for the long run . 
the strings sound great on my full size acoustic - nice bright , but warm tone , full bodied sound - but not so great on my 3/4 size guitar . 
d'addario always puts out a nice product . 
the e and b strings never have enough coating , but still . 
in comparison to others , they do a good job of getting the music out there in a bright and sustained manner . 
arrived beautifully with plenty of time to forward this on to another guitar enthusiest who rarely changes her strings , tune . 
i 'm going to be honest , i have a cheap guitar . 
i payed $ 120 for an epiphone at my local music store because i just play it recreationally . 
-lrb- bonfires , sitting around the house , etc. . -rrb- 
so i 've never really put a nice set of strings on it because i figured strings are n't really going to make that much of a sound difference on this guitar , but i was way way way wrong ! 
these strings are n't even that expensive , actually they 're only a few more dollars than the usual cheap strings i put on my guitar . 
yet , they completely changed the sound of my guitar and it sounds like i forked over some money for a decent guitar ! 
the strings are high quality and they feel so smooth under my fingertips ! 
i used to play once or twice a week , but i ca n't help but want to play every single day just to hear these things sing ! 
i 'm enjoying using this priced-right set of strings . 
i put these strings on my martin guitar after receiving my new dvd from customerservice@peghead.nl entitled `` how to play fingerstyle guitar '' by eltjo haselhoff , whose preview of this great dvd i found on youtube . 
see the preview and look at other youtube videos of eltjo - you 'll want to order the dvd immediately . 
it has been a while since i put new strings on my acoustic guitar . 
these went on with no problems . 
they have a brassy sound to them . 
since purchasing them , they still ring nicely . 
i have not used mine yet but my brother in law says it looks like i got the same strings on my guitar already i trust him he knows more about guiatars than i do tried them all . 
these are the best sounding in my book . 
they last pretty long for non-coated strings and play nicely , too . 
d'addario makes a pretty good string , but i 'd have to say i prefer the elixir . 
the sound is a little brighter , and the strings last longer with elixir . 
do n't get me wrong though , i still like these . 
if there 's a sale , i 'll buy some more . 
i love the strings so far , just put them on my jasmine by takamine guitar today -lrb- 2-20-14 -rrb- and they sound amazing , very bright tone , i will be using d'addario strings from now on , very pleased with them . 
works exactly like its ad says it would , eliminates pops and secondary noises in the background , easy to install , nice looking regular strings . 
they work , and they last . 
they have a worm sound and i really like that , and with my takamine they sound great these strings sound great . 
i was really impressed by the sound . 
they stay in tune very nicely . 
great for beginners and intermediate players . 
i would recommend them . 
i 've used d'addario strings for bass , electric , acoustic , and classic . 
even though this string was my first time use and it have n't failed me yet !! 
it 's very stable and in tune all time while playing . 
highly recommand to other ppl i bought a rogue mandolin from a friend -lrb- who bought from amazon but did not have time to even play it -rrb- for only 25 $ , still brand new , never played.i have owned and played many other mandolins -lrb- about a dozen -rrb- , this one is mainly for me to practice my mandolin setup skills . 
the mandolin is not playable in its brand new state -lrb- not in tune , action too high , lower action will result in string buzzes -rrb- . 
and this is quite typical for a new mandolin without a proper setup . 
i went thru all the necessary steps -lrb- almost like a luthier would do -rrb- and it came out sweet . 
it now has very low action , no string buzz , very good intonation . 
one can find info about mandolin setup on the web . 
it 's quite tedious work.this will be my beater mandolin , at 25 $ , nothing can beat it.it stay in tune long enough for me to play one hour straight without having to re-tune . 
so this is more than adequate for daily practice . 
often times , it even stay in tune the next days . 
i may consider replacing the tuner machines with better one . 
the finish on this model has some blemish -lrb- some small black spots on top the sunburst color -rrb- , but only if you look really close , i would consider this as defects if the mando cost a few hundred , at less than 40 $ , no problem at all.of course , this mandolin is no match for more expensive models/brands -lrb- such as kentucky -rrb- but i gave it a 5 stars based on its high performance / cost ratio.if you do n't know how to setup mandolin , then be prepared to pay 60 $ to 80 $ for a professional setup -lrb- which is a must , otherwise the mandolin is hard to play and does not play in tune -rrb- . 
some reviews gave this mandolin a bad rating due to this lack of knowledge -lrb- that 's unfair -rrb- . 
all brand new mandolins require setup -lrb- at this expense -rrb- , unless the store did the setup and charge a higher price for it.if you are lucky to know someone who can setup for free , that would save you the cost of two mandolins like this !!! 
addario strings are ok . . 
although like beauty it is in the eyes of the beholder ... aquila seems to be the most popular now . 
i have used both and i am satisfied with both ... i play the soprano , concert , tenor , and baritone . 
each one different in it on right ... also play the the concert scale banjolele . . 
only been playing the uke for 5 years and the banjo for 10 so it is only imho . 
be aware though that 10 years experience can mean 1 year experience 10 times :-rrb- -rrb- -rrb- -rrb- bought these strings as a replacement to ones that came with my ukulele -lrb- the originals only lasted a week -rrb- . 
these d'addario 's have worn quite well and still sound excellent . 
great strings ! 
i tried the dean markley blue steel light accoustic strings on my takamine guitar , and will soon replace them . 
on quality control , the high e steel string in the set looks bad with dark spots on it , two of which show after stringing the guitar . 
string did not break as i rather expected , but it looks bad . 
on sound , these seemed okay at first , but i still find it hard to keep in tune after a week , especially the high b and e steel strings , which just do n't sound that good to me . 
and i find the low e wound string notes tend to be too high as i move up the neck , more so than other sets i have used.guess i 'll go back to d'addario and ernie ball . 
if you expect to get what you pay for , prepare to be disappointed . 
sounds weak . 
sounds old . 
sounds worn . 
sounds dull . 
i wanted to experience a new brand on my stratocaster . 
i can afford to pay twice as much . 
but i am going to keep using my d'adario strings from now on . 
i am so disappointed . 
these strings are for the &#34; campfire guitarist &#34; not the aggressive picking thrilling , tapping , pull offs , or sweepers . 
if you are a tone fanatic keep looking . 
if your guitar deserves the best , do not betray your instrument or insult your tube amp with these strings . 
respect your guitar . 
i would n't be surprised if they are made from china . 
what can i say that has not been said about the other drs that i have used . 
they rock , roll , andbend with the greatest of ease ; once broken in , of course . 
if you want a mellower , bluesier stringwith decent sustain try dr pure blues.i decided to use 9 's on my fender tele hollow-body because the company puts 9s on their guitars.i did n't want to worry about the nut being the wrong size and causing untold noises so i stuckwith the 9s . 
hey , the rev uses 7 's ; size does not matter when it comes to strings and tone.the other reason for the pure nickels was to tone down the ice pickiness one can get from p-90pick ups . 
pure nickels seem to mellow that out for me a bit . 
one more reason is that nickel iseasier on your frets ; which is a good thing . 
steel will wear down your frets a lot faster.i will say that my very first set of dr pure blues went bad after a few weeks . 
the windings brokeon the d-string at two places where the string fretted . 
the reason i kept going back to dr bluesis that i have not had one problem on any of my electric guitars -lrb- 4 solid bodies & another hollow-body -rrb- since then . 
giving dr a second chance convinced me they will last and that my very firstuse in 2010 was a fluke.if you want strings that are an easier bend than steel or steel core nickels go with dr pure blues.allegedly they are supposed to help give you vintage tone . 
this is because prior to the mid-40 ` smost strings were made of nickel . 
during wwii nickel was in short supply and so steel was used tomake the strings . 
or so the historical theory goes.gradually nickel wrapped steel strings and then pure nickel strings came back into vogue as playersbegan searching for the old vintage sound . 
to achieve the `` vintage '' tone i am sure you would alsoneed the right amp and the right touch to get to that point . 
i am not necessarily looking for a `` vintage '' tone but love how easily these strings bend and how long they last . 
your exact mileagemay differ.i have also never had anything rub off of the strings onto my fingers . 
the only time i get my fingersdirty is after oiling the fret board . 
there is usually is some residual oil left no matter how much i wipethe fret board . 
definitely not the strings though . 
i have also never heard any string-squeak from thestrings that would give me pause either . 
any string , even on acoustic , will squeak occasionally . 
withan electric who knows if the pickups were set too high , or the nut is not cut right , or the wrong sizestring is used for the nut.well there you go ; what i have experienced with dr pure blues nickel wrap round core strings . 
i willalso say that on guitar forums that i frequent more people are giving dr kudos on their customerservice as well as their strings . 
so if you do get a bum string give them a holler . 
now get out thereand play your heart out . 
oh and how about working on that `` vintage '' tone while you are at it.have fun . 
i automatically put these on any guitar i own as soon as i buy it , i change strings and toss those white plastic pins . 
makes any guitar look so much classier ! 
i swear there is a slight increase in the richness of the tone too ! 
phenominal value , tons of bang for the buck they look soooo good on there ... installed easily in 3 different guitars so far . 
these pins are amazing . 
one u never have to worry about breaking them . 
they look really nice and they do add noticeable sustain . 
very cool . 
these are very good quality in spite of their reasonable price . 
i love the flat , low profile , right angle plugs . 
my only complaint is i needed some in varying lengths -lrb- like 15 &#34; -rrb- and so i had to order the planet waves kit to make my own to finish the pedalboard . 
hands down , in my opinion these are by far the best guitar straps you can get . 
i have a few of planet waves different designs for these , all on my electrics . 
i have an acoustic-electric ibanez but the strap would n't fit , however the strap was n't purchased for the acoustic - i was just trying it on all of my different guitars for reviewers sake.if you 're considering buying this , just do it . 
i typically use dimarzio cliplocks on all my basses and electric guitars . 
they work very well for my needs . 
however , i bought a junker bass for outdoor gigs and to play at places where i do n't care what happens to the gear . 
this strap is perfect for those needs . 
a nice nylon and the lock works wellbutthe locking portion might be a little thick for some strap buttons . 
it works on the bass i use it on , but not my gibson sg , so be aware . 
i would buy more of these if i needed a cheap strap . 
this strap replaces another one just like it which i use with an acoustic guitar for giving lessons . 
for stage i like something heavier . 
good quality . 
the holes work with my strap buttons okay . 
my lower button is an output jack for an after-market pickup which is wider than a normal strap button . 
but this strap works okay with it . 
it just takes a little more force to get it on which i 'm sure will go away over time with use . 
great price for a simple strap at around $ 5 . 
if all you 're looking for is an inexpensive way to hang your guitar , until you can afford a good quality leather strap , this is it . 
the quality and function of the strap is actually better than i expected , for the amount paid . 
works perfectly for me , it does got a nice made.plus nothing could beat its price , so , get it ! 
get strap for the price , does what it is supposed to do and is comfortable too . 
glad i purchased it this is a very very nice guitar strap . 
comes with dual locking strap holes on each end . 
very nice for creating a great grip on your guitar so they wo n't fall off . 
i originally bought the cheaper version and sent it back and got this one . 
very good for the price . 
this strap is not a bad one , but it just did not fit my guitar , so that is the only problem . 
i have a classical guitar and sadly , this strap does not fit it . 
it 's a strap . 
it 's pretty well made . 
it holds your guitar on your body so you can play it . 
it costs $ 5 or less delivered ... what more could you ask for in a strap ??? there may be better ones out there , but at more $ $ and this does the same thing . 
these planet waves locking straps work very well on most guitars with standard-size strap pins . 
once locked , they 're not going anywhere . 
what you need to be careful about is that you have to use some common sense - the locking end , once fastened , can act as a lever to pull the pin out of the guitar if pressure is put on it a certain way . 
for this reason , you would want to be careful when using it on acoustic , hollow , or semi-hollow guitars . 
and i certainly would n't keep this strap on a guitar when it 's going to be carried in a gig bag . 
keeping this in mind , these straps are an efficient , inexpensive way to be sure your guitar wo n't break loose of its strap . 
these are great guitar straps at a very reasonable price !! 
i bought 2 to try them out , and i intend on buying more !! 
this is not my first planet waves locking strap . 
they have never failed . 
though the selection of colors and widths are very , very limited , it will keep your guitar secure if you can live with those limitations . 
obviously if you have your heart on a certain strap other than these then go ahead and purchase straplocks . 
but for me these work just fine . 
highly recommended . 
sure it 's a bit pricey , but i think having a top-notch power supply for your pedalboard is priceless . 
just being able to do away with a power strip or two full of wall warts is amazing in itself . 
the fact thing this cuts down on floor noise and conditions your power supply too ? 
sign me up . 
pair this up with a pedaltrain board , and you 've got yourself a sweet setup . 
great universal power supply for your pedals , and the ability to mount it under your board makes it awesome . 
i have two of these that i mount under my board and they power all my pedals perfectly . 
would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a unit to power all their pedals with , and you wo n't get any noise interference with its isolated outputs . 
this is a great product that does what it says . 
it 's a tad pricey , but all in all well worth it . 
my only complaint is that it 's not labeled in a way that you can identify what outlet is what when it 's mounted in a pedal train ... other than that , it 's a great device ! 
i really wanted this to work , but it does n't . 
do n't bother , it does n't mute the strings at all . 
one star , just for it getting here on time . 
it doesnt completely mute my violin but i suppose nothing really can , it does take the loud peircing noise out though i can not evaluate the product until the instrument i purchased is repaired or returned . 
sorry , i had rather not comment until it is used . 
takes the edge off the violin sound . 
i keep it on my office violin so i do n't disturb my neighbors which is silly because they are honduran spanish instructors and they sing shakira at ridiculous volume constantly ... . 
the pedal itself works perfectly fine . 
using it as a foot pedal controller on my korg triton le.it squeaks . 
needs some wd-40 :-rrb- i was a bit skeptical on purchasing this pedal based on some of the reviews here , however most of the problems seemed related to using it as a volume pedal as opposed to an expression pedal . 
i only wanted this so that i could pair it with my re-20 to control the intensity , and in that aspect , i can confirm that it works/pairs flawlessly . 
my only complaint is that the pedal seems to be extremely sensitive . 
for example ; i tested using it as an expression pedal to control the filter of a vst synthesizer , and it was recognized and mapped without issue , but rocking the pedal ever-so-slightly would cause erratic movement on the filter . 
this is the same behavior that i have when connected to the re-20 , in that the slightest pedal movement will make the intensity or repeat rate to jump in a fashion that 's anything but gradual . 
it 's not the end of the world , but i was hoping that the movement would have been a bit more precise . 
excellent mic , rugged with great sound and zero extraneous noise.does not have an on/off switch which is a bit disappointing . 
first of all this is not the best microphone ever made . 
but for what they cost they certainly are more than i expected . 
i give it 4 stars as a microphone period , without even taking the low cost into consideration . 
they are so much better than the next cheapest thing that they are worth the extra $ 5 for sure . 
i bought one behringer xm8500 then two more a couple of months later planning to use them as rehearsal microphones for a geezer band start up about 5 years go . 
however , we actually have used these for vocals at some live performances when the sound tech 's personal sm-58 's are busy at another job . 
i honestly think we sound about the same either way and maybe a little clearer with the behringers . 
at one time alice cooper and his band were using the behringer xm8500 's , however they may have moved on now for all i know.these are not shure sm-58 clones even though they appear to be cosmetic knockoffs . 
they have a slightly hotter output and a more flat response to my ears while the shure 's have a more pronounced lower mid boost that makes the male voice sound bigger and sometimes more distorted if not eq ` ed correctly . 
they are an ideal backup vocal microphone since the behringer behaves like a compromise between a microphone tailored for a male voice and a microphone tailored for a female voice and actually works well without heavy eq . 
it also is if anything more versatile than the sm-58 as it can be useful as an acoustic instrument pickup microphone working for anything that you would ordinarily use an sm-57 to pick up . 
it does n't overload easily , has a high output and a tight pattern with about the same feedback rejection as the sm-58 . 
it has a reasonably decent blast filter , so if using it for outdoor instrument pickup you do n't have to add a windscreen . 
another strength of these is durability . 
my 3 have sustained numerous drops , a couple of falls happened while boom stand mounted so not only did the microphone fall but the weight of the boom stand was behind it adding more mass to the force of the fall . 
no damage at all to any of them ! 
i used to cringe when they fell or got dropped but now i just shrug . 
one weak point about these is they are more sensitive to handling noise , but on the stand handling noise is no issue . 
mine came in hard plastic foam lined cases with stand adapters . 
the stand adapters are sort of flimsy but usable . 
if you want sm-58 's you need to buy sm-58 's . 
if you want a good all around microphone in the $ 20 to $ 40 class then try one of these . 
no on-off switch on these but we do have switches on some of the sm-58 's we use and frankly the on-off switch is a liability ! 
i do n't think you can find a better microphone new for the money and recommend them as a decent all-around microphone for the price . 
you can pay more and get less . 
works great especially for the price . 
just put a little more highs and mids when you eq it , and its pretty close to the sm58 . 
this is a great quality microphone and at a good price . 
keep it mind it is xlr , for those that have n't noticed . 
xlr is a better quality than other connections . 
it 's the same physical shape and size as a rock band microphone -lrb- looking for a good comparison . -rrb- 
, and is much better quality . 
it 's flawless in quality and does n't give any feedback . 
i would recomment for anyone , especially having such a great price . 
wow wow i ca n't believe it working wonderful.i 'm using it karaoke online in paltalk.i did compairation with somes i have , it 's perfect vocal.i connected it with mixer alesis 8 input.i wish it 's built with switch on/offrecomend to buyer . 
thanks amazon working great on my stratocaster . 
excellent purchase . 
feels good to switch positions solid and quiet . 
i should 've bought this to replace the original switch from the start . 
perfect oem . 
one word of warning , if you are not good at soldering and/or you do n't have a good iron , do n't try this yourself . 
the contacts are very thin and will burn up in a hurry . 
i recomend readingthe fender stratocaster handbook : how to buy , maintain , set up , troubleshoot , and modify your stratif you are unsure . 
it would be improper for me to claim that these fit stratocasters , because i have a stratocaster remake and i drilled new holes for a stratocaster pickguard to get the screws in . 
what i can say is that the packaging is nice and does n't seem cheapo -lrb- surprised it did n't come all scattered in an envelope or in a ziplock bag -rrb- the size of the screws was right , the dark chrome finish on the screws is pretty slick , and it came with more than enough to install a stratocaster pickguard . 
i 'm sure the screws are the right length to fit authentic stratocasters anyways . 
i bought these because i am constantly loosing screws when i change pickguards or do new builds.these are exactly what the doctor ordered . 
original equipment so they 're the right screws , a must have for every guitarist , no matter what brand you own as they work on everything.these are well made and do n't strip when screwing in for the first time . 
if it 's a new project , always drill pilot holes anyway . 
i am so glad i bought these , one by one they are being used ... almost time to order another set.i store them in a little sandwich bag . 
5 stars you get more than enough screws to install a front pickguard and a tremolo on your stratocaster , however this lacks the two longer screws near the bridge on the front pickguard . 
other than the two missing screws , this hardware is a great replacement for any missing or oxidized hardware on your stratocaster . 
what can i say ? 
fits perfectly for a pickguard on a fender style guitar . 
you could probably find them at a cheap hardware store , but i was too lazy to go looking . 
pickguard screws . 
the screws are not very tough and you have to be gentle with them so that the screwdriver does n't bugger up the heads . 
they are not high enough quality that they can be put in and taken out more than a couple of times before they become worn . 
replacing your pickguard ? 
lost a screw ? 
authentic replacement screws if you need them . 
i ordered these with a new pickguard for my strat in case i lost or boogered up one of the screws . 
exactly like stock screws . 
i was a little disappointed . 
do n't know if it 's a qc problem or if i just got some rejects but out of 6 pots , 1 was out of spec -lrb- 315k -rrb- and 2 were almost out -lrb- 289k , 205k -rrb- . 
1 was right on the money and the other 2 were within 10 % . 
they are ctl 's so i 'm a bit confused . 
other than that they work fine , they have the nut , washer and cap included -lrb- no knob -rrb- . 
i will be upgrading the caps . 
hi , i thought these pots would come without the proper caps , it ` s not on the description of the product , and they did , so i 'm pleased by it , have not installed them yet ... they are cts brand , it ` s hard to read what uf are the caps , i think they are 0.022 uf the standard for fender guitars ordered 6 , and out of 6 , i have exactly zero flat washers . 
does n't match the picture . 
caps are marked 223k , so , looking that up , they are 0.022 uf . 
pot , lockwasher , nut , and cap are what is included . 
i used this on my last stratocaster build . 
it arrived quickly and was well packaged . 
it is black and has a kind of white stripe along the edge , so if you are looking for just a solid black pickguard , be aware . 
the cool thing about this pickguard is that it already has aluminum on the back . 
i was shielding and star grounding all of my guitars and one of the painful parts was spraying adhesive on the back of pickguards and then putting foil on them and cutting it to fit . 
these already come with foil , so there is no need to shield them any more than they already are.it fit my body perfectly and i am happy with the purchase . 
i would think it would be reasonable to assume that this would fit a squier bullet strat , but the holes did n't line up , it did n't fit between the neck and the bridge , in fact , it was completely wrong . 
nice quality though . 
it fit my american vintage 70 's strat . 
my guitar had an 11-hole pickguard . 
i ordered an 11-hole pickguard and it fit like a glove.the guitar is 3-ply plastic , black/white/black . 
this is what most black fender genuine replacement pickguards will look like.i am happy with the purchase . 
bought this a while back just got around to installing it on my mexi strat . 
does n't fit perfect . 
kinda bummed but oh well spipped and received on time , it fits , it works , it is heavier guage than most replacements . 
happy with it - like it . 
item arrived as described and on time - way larger than expected , but my son loved it ! 
says it 's easier to use than the smaller cloths we 've gotten before . 
this cloth is perfect for wiping your guitar down after a playing session . 
a guitar is an investment and you should protect it . 
a good polish cloth is a must . 
a bit wimpy , but so far they are holding up . 
they fit fine . 
works as described lol . 
comes with the screws and the &#34; cotton &#34; washers so you dont scratch the body . 
what to say about this accept that they mounted properly , came with the right screws and i didnt have any issues . 
lol these knobs arrived in perfect condition , the correct color and fit my stratocaster remake well . 
you ca n't necessarily go wrong with knobs . 
i like the black look to my guitar now . 
i 've ordered two of these kits in the aged white , and each one has had severe scratches and scuffs all over the tremolo cavity cover plate . 
literally to the point where it looks like someone dropped them on a concrete floor , accidentally stepped on them , and then decided they were good enough to send out for sale . 
the knobs , covers and tips are all in great shape , however . 
i have a fender stratocaster mim with standard white pickguard , which i changed by a black one . 
then i decided also change others white pieces , and this fender accessory kit fit perfect in my guitar . 
i did n't need no adaptation to install it on guitar . 
kudos to fender for making an amp like this available at this price point . 
it has 25 watts of power , a 10 inch speaker , a real spring reverb , and it 's a traditional analog circuit without a digital processor . 
it will make your electric guitar sound pretty much the way it 's supposed to.the downside is that when i compare this amp to what fender was selling fifteen years ago , the champion 110 , it falls a little short . 
the particle board cabinet is thinner , the speaker is less hefty , and the whole thing feels and sounds a little less substantial . 
it 's obvious that the bean counters really pushed to get this thing as inexpensive as it is , and they also moved production to indonesia from mexico . 
maybe weight is a factor in shipping it across the ocean.all the same , i can still recommend it because it beats the crap out of digital amps and it gives you substantial power and a 10 '' speaker and real fender tone and looks . 
fender probably figures that players flush with cash will prefer a well-made tube amp or an amp with tons of digital modeling , but i kind of wish they still produced a solid 25 watt analog practice/light gigging amp . 
i actually bought this amp at a pawn shop for $ 60 , but i would have paid the retail price if i had bought it new , with no complaints . 
for such a small combo , this amp really packs a punch . 
it is plenty loud , and is just fine for smaller club gigs . 
however , you could use it in larger venues also , since you generally mic up your amp anyway , and get most of your sound from monitors.anyway , the clean channel is what you would expect from any fender amp , with good tone and crisp reverb . 
the high gain channel is really fat sounding . 
i still use distortion pedals , and generally leave it on the clean channel so i can switch back and forth between clean and distortion with ease -lrb- not sure if there is a foot switch for the amp , since my pawn shop purchase didnt include one -rrb- , but without a pedal , the high gain channel performs adequately.for the price , this is really an upper echelon amp in my opinion . 
kind of does away with the need for a half stack , unless you are really gigging frequently at larger venues or outdoors . 
plus , it is far lighter and easier to transport , lol . 
great value and the heavy base easily holds a professional mic or instrument mic.great price ! 
very happy and shipped from amazon perfectly with great packing . 
i bought 5 of these for live recording of my band . 
they adjust easil for most any amplifier height yet stable enough for on stage recoding . 
i recomend these for anyone that needs a low cost means to place mics on a live stage . 
features : stable base ; good extension ; easy hand grip to lock/unlock for adjusting . 
for me it was a good perchase . 
great for the desktop and vocals . 
i have also used it successfully on the guitar cabinet . 
it 's an important component in my studio . 
my first desk mic stand , and the adjuster part broke after only two days of use . 
it worked once when i originally set it , then kaput . 
it 's never worked properly since . 
i still use it but have to wrap electrical tape so that it 's at the right height . 
i would not purchase this product again . 
every time i have ever used a desk mike , i 've always had to lean into it because the stand was too short . 
this little stand adjusts about six inches , so it 's possible to get the mike right at mouth level without bending over . 
i bought this stand a few months ago and it has held up quite well . 
for only $ 12.00 it is a steal , the stand is extremely sturdy and pretty heavy . 
i have used it with multiple mics such as the audio technica 2020 with the samson sp01 shock-mount , a rode k2 , a studio projects c1 and a neumann tlm 103 . 
i have not had any problems and the stand is heavy enough to use with basically any mic . 
i was not going to write a review for this product but i came across another review that stated `` i purchased this stand as people had reviewed this to work with a at2020 with a sp01 shockmount . 
mine must have been missing a part as it does not connect no matter what i try . '' 
this is absolutely false . 
the samson sp01 shock-mount works perfectly with this stand -lrb- as any shock-mount or mic would , since the threading is a standard size -rrb- . 
i just wanted to clear that up so that there would not be any confusion . 
also almost every shock-mount has an adapter in the mount -lrb- where the shock-mount connects to the mic stand -rrb- that is slightly smaller than most us mic stands , but this comes out !! 
all you have to do is take a coin and unscrew it from the shock-mount . 
after the adapter is out the samson sp01 will connect to this stand . 
i highly recommend this product . 
works for my behringer xm1800s mics . 
it came with a smaller thread adapter on it already . 
idk what mics use that but is something to note . 
i started experimenting on strings , i say , why would n't i try to use bronze strings for my acoustic guitar ? 
awesome i like the brightness of sound it produced . 
i 'm hooked to bronze strings . 
thanks to martin for making the best bronze acoustic guitar strings ! 
martin strings , just wish i could afford a martin guitar . 
they last and they stay in tune . 
sound very good too . 
have not used the strings yet , i bought them as back up . 
have used this type of string before with satisfactory results , good tone , last a long time . 
this strings are just perfect for me because the sound it is nice !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 1 !!!!! so please buy it if you want good strings , i buy this strings from a few years and i love them , i like them with my gibson lp , but also with my other guitar with the floyd ! 
, they are durable , and a really good sound for my funky rock type of music i like ! 
used the 9-42 's for years but thought i would give these a try . 
fuller sound with the 10-46 's buti can not bend them like the 9 's . 
i have switched back on a few of then guitars for variety : 10 's for rhythm and finger style , 9 's for lead . 
get the packs of single 9 's and 10 's too so that when one breaks you dont have to steal from another whole set . 
i have been using these strings for a while now . 
they are consistent , sound good , have a good life , and are very well priced through amazon . 
they are crisp and vibrant when new and this lasts for quite a while . 
i will continue to buy them by the dozen for my electric guitars . 
these strings are good , especially for the price . 
i have found better strings through d'addario however , and the feel of them is superior to these in my opinion . 
this is a pack of guitar strings . 
it sounds good on my guitar and it 's not that expensive . 
i like it -lrb- 4 star rating according to amazon -rrb- . 
i would rate it 5 stars -lrb- amazon rating for 5 stars is if you ` love ' the product -rrb- , if it made me sound like clapton unfortunately , none of the gear that i bought can do this ! 
also , i kind of find it hard to ` love ' a pack of guitar strings . 
ernie balls are nice strings , cheap , durable and produce a rich sound . 
i 'm so proud of my balls . 
great strings . 
bends are easy . 
stay in tune well . 
shipping was fast and i 'd definitely recommend these . 
john mayer , and other of my favorite musicians use these strings , there great . 
very good strings the ernie ball super slinky string set -lrb- 9 - 42 -rrb- are a great set of string to replace my old string with on my guitar . 
they feel and sound great when you play them . 
highly recommend these strings ... . 
good strings . . 
great for general guitar work , but i do prefer the eb rock n ' roll strings for blues and rock playing . 
these are my personal favorites when it comes to guitar strings.i would reccomend these to everyone and the price is the best decent strings but the little e string broke while i was stringing the guitar.other than that , they appear ok.nothing to rave about . 
since they are light strings they are easier to press down and easier to bend which really helps me because i 'm a beginner and do n't have much calais yet . 
also i like the first day of new strings look shiny ! 
i would recommend this to any beginner . 
these tubes just are n't for me . 
they do n't sound great ... kind of flat and lifeless . 
also unreliable . 
one -lrb- out of 7 -rrb- arrived doa and another has failed since . 
spend a few extra bucks and get a music stand that is sturdier ! 
these ca n't support heavy stuff and will knock over so easily . 
they sure are portable though . 
not a bad idea to keep one in your car just in case since it folds up to be so tiny ! 
this little music stand folds up small enough -lrb- after some disassembly -rrb- to fit in a pouch less than 2 feet tall and 2 inches wide . 
once assembled , it stands straight and is more than sturdy enough for sheet music or most softbound books . 
the height is adjustable so you should be able to find a comfortable position whether you 're standing , seated on a stool or in a chair . 
the angle of the tray is not adjustable . 
the legs are simple flat metal pieces and could be susceptible to being bent if you trip over it , so this might not be the best stand if you plan to keep it in one location . 
but for a portable stand , it 's hard to find fault with this one , especially given the low cost . 
i purchased the on stage brand microphone stand to use with a theremin , although i may use it at some point for the purpose for which it was designed . 
this is a substantial , stable , very solidly built stand . 
the base is heavy enough the i ca n't image that the stand would fall over in normal use . 
should the need arise , it is also easy to disassemble and assemble . 
highly recommended . 
not much i can say about a standard mic stand . 
unless it was a cheap piece of crap . 
this one is not . 
nice heavy base plate . 
here is my only complaint : i went to remove the upc sticker on the shaft and now i have a mess . 
i 'll try some wd-40 to get the annoying residue off but for crying out loud , ca n't anyone come up with a sticker that is removable without a headache ? 
and as an end user , a upc sticker serves nobody . 
why is it even there ? 
put it on the box it comes in but get it off of the merchandise i 'm buying ! 
there a hundreds of distortion pedals on the market today . 
sure , some are said to be the best at this or that , but for me the rat is the one that does it all . 
and at a great price to boot . 
this pedal is not new to me . 
i 've had a few of them in the past , but the rat 2 is just a great as the older `` vintage '' models . 
goes from a nice bit of drive that is far better than a tube screamer , to a near fuzztone , with some warm , smooth creamy tones in between . 
remarkable . 
no other distortion pedal can do it as well . 
i 've been playing for 5 decades and have had more than my share of them . 
but the rat delivers . 
no joke . 
it just does it all , and well.the filter -lrb- tone -rrb- is set up where the tone gets deeper by going clockwise rather than counter clockwise . 
that might thow a few folks off , but it 's a little thing really . 
the filter is the core of it 's tone and the distortion control is very linear in how it increases the distortion . 
by going higher with the distortion control , the volume only goes up a little . 
that 's great as making changes while playing is less of a hastle if you just lean over and bump it up a bit , the volume wo n't go through the roof .100 % silent switching . 
no hum . 
no buzz . 
and no loss or increase of your overall level when you engage the unit . 
flawless comes to mind here . 
easy to set up . 
strong as a tiger tank . 
and just flat out gives you what you want without all the fuss of 6 or 8 knobs for you to mess with . 
and the three that are there all glow in the dark like all the rats of the past . 
kinda cool if you ask me.if one wants a good distortion pedal that will perform without issues , get yourself a rat . 
if you want to impress your friends with how much money you dumped on a `` boo-teek '' pedal that sits in the rat 's shadow , buy that high dollar unit and you can at least `` look good '' while you play . 
but your tone will still stink . 
its up to you . 
me ? 
its a no brainer . 
i go with the rat ... . 
as far as tried and true distortion pedals go , this is really just average . 
the filter doesnt have enough of an impact on the pedal to provide a truly large range from fuzz to metal distortion . 
compared to other distortion pedals , it really fails in this regard . 
however , if used as a fuzz pedal instead , it truly shines , since this is really what it is . 
does it have distortion ? 
yes . 
is it valuable as such ? 
not in my opinion . 
it isnt condensed enough to be used strictly as that . 
another gripe i have is the 9 volt slot . 
most pedals use a universal design which allows you to use almost any power supply . 
not so with this pedal . 
you are pretty much relegated to their own adapter or batteries , which sux imo , especially since i run all my pedals off an adapter chain.anyways , while this is fun to play with , you should definitely consider the sound you are going for . 
if you prefer to play a more grungy or 70 's era metal , then this will work for you . 
for more crisp sound , you should look elsewhere . 
imo tried it , did n't like it , returned it . 
just not my cup of tone , that 's all . 
i have more use for an overdrive . 
i does the job that i wanted it for . 
just to keep picks in my guitar case . 
it 's okay but it could be better . 
i like the product , i like the idea to have something that can hold the picks so they dont get lost , i thought that it could hold a few more picks . 
i think i putted about 7 picks in it , but hey , it works and i would buy it again.i forgot to say that there is double sided tape on the back if you want to put it on your guitar -lrb- thats what i did , it looks good and durable -rrb- . 
also , it 's cheap !!!!! old good design . 
for the price i 've bought 4 of them and just put it on all guitars , so would n't have to search for pick again very good reliable product to help keep track of your guitar picks.only thing i can see negative about it is that you can not fit very many picks inside of it.it does help to have a few stowed away for when you need them.i was not satisfied with the extent of time it took them to ship this product to me.it seemed to take forever although it has nothing to do with the product and only the vendor i ordered the product from.dunlop has always created some very top quality products for guitar players.they have a great reputation and they uphold a high level of quality no matter what the product usually.this product as advertised did not come with any picks.if you order this and need picks make sure you order picks separately . 
casual , part time guitar player here . 
i use it on the back of the headstock to always have picks with the guitar when i pick it up . 
the one i received was all black , not brown on the sides as in the photo . 
no matter . 
it is a bit larger than you might expect from the photo . 
i dont know if that is to accommodate a larger size of pick , or what . 
it is big enough that ` normal ' electric guitar picks can almost turn sideways in it . 
it also likes to give you more than one pick at a time . 
both of which i would say make it not a contender for fast pick replacement , like in the middle of a song . 
but it is good for keeping them all in one place , either on the guitar or a desk , toolbox , etc.nice little item for $ 2 i used to be that guy that lost about 30 guitar picks a month . 
i bought three of these dunlop pick holders , one for each of the three gauges i find myself constantly using , and they 've more than paid for themselves in the short time i 've had them . 
i bought this for my brother for a christmas gift when we got him a guitar . 
he never used it , but not because of anything to do with the actual product its a one dollar pice of plastic that holds your picks , it has a spring in it that pushes them up like a dispenser in a way . 
has sticky stuff on the back so you can stick it to your guitar or case so you always have picks . 
this is a nice pick holder , especially for the price . 
it sticks well to the guitar and is easy to use . 
this is a great little addition to my guitar because otherwise picks end up getting lost everywhere . 
one note : this does not come with any picks . 
one customer said it did , but mine did not . 
it has a sticky pad on the back , and sticks well to a wood guitar . 
i even moved it once , and it still sticks fine . 
it is spring loaded so that the top pick easily slides out . 
this was another filler item for a much larger order . 
i am always losing my guitar picks and this helps me keep track . 
simple idea but a good one . 
thanks . 
this is the best cleaning product i 've ever used . 
not only do i use it on my maple and rosewood fretboards , but i also use it on the headstock if it 's unfinished and on the unfinished body of my ukulele . 
what it does is it restores the wood in a way that it gives it a much more brilliant , beautiful and lively tone . 
really brings out the beauty of true wood . 
now every fretboard and unfinished bit of wood on my guitars looks beautiful and brand new . 
application method is also very useful . 
i do n't know why there is a strict warning saying not to use it on maple fretboards ; i put it on my stratocaster 's maple fretboard and it looks beautiful . 
the only thing it did differently was it made the fretboard a good shade darker . 
i also must add that the stuff has a very wonderful lemony smell -lrb- nowhere near overpowering -rrb- , and it does clean off a lot of dirt in conjunction to hydrating and livening the wood . 
great stuff . 
go ahead and buy it . 
so far still made in america . 
i have been using formula 65 guitar polish for over 40 years since a time when my hair was longer as a hippie growing up with heavy metal . 
i 've polished many guitars multiple times . 
this gets the grime and fingerprints off the body and neck keeping the instrument looking like new . 
it works great on acoustic and electric , solid or hollow body , acrylic or lacquer finishes without streaking . 
it even cleans finger ease lubricants off the neck and strings . 
i have n't needed other products separately for the neck or strings since this works great on both . 
makes the fretboard feel like new ; but best to clean with alcohol wipes first . 
i think most woods will appreciate being treated with this oil ; especially in dry environments . 
i love this stuff for all my fretboards , accept for unusually dirty ones . 
if it is super grundgy , clean it with something stronger , than follow-up with this stuff . 
leaves the wood nourished and new looking without any greasy feel . 
i usually apply it twice in a row and wipe clean each time . 
works great - keeps all my fretboards looking great . 
even though i change strings frequently on my twelve -lrb- 12 -rrb- acoustic electric guitars this bottle will last forever . 
i play hard for several hours almost every day and i 'm always amazed at the &#34; crud &#34; that accumulates on the fretboards . 
-lrb- guess i 'll have to stop eating cheetos while i 'm playing - just kidding ... -rrb- this oil breaks down the &#34; crud &#34; and restores the look of the fretboard to new condition . 
no issues / no problems only positive things to say about the oil ... i play bass in a lot of different environments , and i never know what to expect before i show up . 
if i am playing a venue where i can use my head and 4x12 combo i know i 'll have great tone . 
if i am going direct into the board i am at the mercy of the house equipment and engineer . 
this unit gives me ; the ability to still go direct , but allows me to tweak the signal for maximum warmth . 
i suppose you could look at this like an effects stomp box but it is really so much more . 
if you play at church and are tired of hearing the life sucked out of your bass you should give this a try . 
i love it . 
this thing sounds great ! 
i run two outputs from this into my daw -lrb- reaper -rrb- , so that i can have a direct di for reamping and the regular tone from the hartke 's preamp for an overall bass tone . 
the general sound of it is warm with plenty of low end , and the `` shape '' control is pretty cool for adding a little bit of distortion/break-up for layering . 
it 's easy to reamp with , so layering the unshaped hartke tone + another track of shaped `` gritty '' tone can get you some seriously solid sounding bass tones in a mix - especially for higher gain metal playing.awesome unit for the price , very happy with it . 
i 'm using this as a di box for recording . 
it does some compression , overdrive , eq ` ing , notch eq ` ing , and excite-ing all in one pedal . 
so compared to the original bass signal , you get this clear , deep , punchy sound that fits right into a mix.the bass attack sounds a lot like a sansamp bass driver but at 1/3 the price . 
one difference is that it has an additional `` shape '' knob , which is a lot like the isf knob on blackstar products , and is a notch filter . 
the other difference is that the sansamp uses tougher chassis and components , so would last longer for the gigging musician . 
but do n't take me wrong , the bass attack uses a solid metal chassis and does n't feel cheap at all.the harmonics knob adds some overdrive , and gets kind of farty when turned up 100 % but sounds pretty good at 75-90 % . 
it does n't do that high gain super gritty/fizzy distortion though , for that you could connect a distortion pedal to the parallel output , or duplicate the track in your daw and add a distortion plugin.this pedal is very versatile . 
i found that the shape knob is indispensable ; it takes the place of a mid control . 
for example , by notching -lrb- reducing -rrb- the boomy 60-130 hz region and turning up the level , you get plenty more mids . 
the treble and bright control seem very similar to each other , one seems to amplify the 4k region , the other the 5k but that 's just an estimate . 
by keeping both of those around 10 o'clock and the shape control beneath 115 hz , i can get a solid , deep , yet mid-full sound for a metal mix . 
thus anyone who thinks this pedal is all bass and treble and no mids , ought to try settings along those lines.another good feature is that this pedal can run on 48v phantom power . 
as in , no adapter or battery needed when recording direct or running to a mixer . 
in conclusion , for recording , you can duplicate the sansamp sound that you hear on a lot of albums using the bass attack , and tweak it further via the shape control . 
and yes , the various button pushes get you four different sounds total , but i prefer having both buttons on . 
then in my daw i only throw on an extra compressor and it sounds great . 
this pedal is a steal for no frills bass di recording . 
i have used ernie ball strings on my les paul for quite a while , slinkys mostly . 
i recently bought a yamaha fg700s and quickly found that the high e string had a very `` tinny '' tone . 
i searched the net to see if this was comon with this model , alas i found that it is.so i decided to try some different strings to see if it would help . 
i ordered a set of earthwood lights and installed them last night.wow , what a difference . 
first the tone is much softer on the e string , second the action feels much more comfortable on strings 1 thru 3 . 
the strings that came on the guitar were yamaha light strings but they were very stiff , especially the b string . 
after a hour of playing with the earthwood strings last night they were much more enjoyable , both tonally and physically . 
not sure how they will last , time will tell.good strings i would recommend them . 
to all heavy music guitarist , i highly recommend this one ! 
try a set of this and you will feel like a rock star ! 
for the price they are awesome strings ... . 
i like the sound -lrb- i like a little heavier sound -rrb- , and i 'm hoping the high e will hold up a little longer than the lower gauge &#34; its always the first to go &#34; . 
you cant beat the price on amazon i paid 9.50 at my music store but i needed strings asap , i will order back ups at this price . 
i have tried a few types of strings on my p90 epiphone les paul , and i find these ernie ball power slinky 11 's to have a lot of power and punch to them , as advertised , and give me the nice tone i was looking for . 
the power and thick sound is due to these strings being a heavier gauge than the strings that usually come with a guitar . 
it will take a little more finger strength to play these but it is worth getting used to . 
these strings work well with the many different types of rock i play , and will work even fine with drop c tuning . 
they have also been as durable as strings get and do not lose their tone for quite some time . 
i prefer these power slinkys over d'addario xl 10 's , over regular slinky 10 's -lrb- which i used to like until i tried these -rrb- , and even prefer them over the more expensive full nickel rock 'n roll slinky 10 's which surprisingly sounded boring when compared to the energy the power slinkys give you . 
i would say the power slinkys give off a sufficiently bright sound , but not excessively bright , and i would recommend them to anyone thinking about giving them a try . 
these strings have a powerful tone for lead work , however they 're not on the bendy side , which is great for rhythm work . 
the tone you get from these is punchy , powerful , and great for rhythm . 
if you need an overall great set of strings , get these . 
you wo n't regret it . 
its good but not fitting my requirement , but its extremely recommend it for beginners because it is very easy to play and bend . . 
but for me as a reggae rhythm guitar its not good and not warm enough and i have one point on the g string specially if you want to lead and solo whenever you start bending you will notice how annoying its because its hard to keep in tune while bending if you used to medium g size this is my first time using a hybrid mix and ti does take some getting used to but i enjoy the heavier bass sounds it provides while maintain easy to bend higher strings . 
installed with no problems , plays pretty well so far . 
it stays in tune pretty well , it 's still the first day and the pitch is holding well . 
these strings are different and really quite nice . 
the high strings are thinner and thus much easier to play and bend . 
the lower strings retain the depth and sound of my usual strings . 
i really like them . 
only possible difficulty is that high e etc might tend to break a little quicker due to being a thinner string . 
i have a bunch of these on hand for my strat and my epiphone as well the standard earnie balls alright strings . 
nothing too spectacular about them . 
i 'm a fan of beefier lows and thinner highs but at the end of the day they 're still slinks . 
i 've always used ernie ball strings . 
i 've tried others & always go back to ernie balls . 
they sound & feel great . 
bend 'em ! 
if you are looking to walk around while you play your guitar , then you might want to look into something longer . 
as a spare cable to play at home though , it 's pretty good . 
it 's a guitar cable . 
it works . 
it appears to be well made and durable . 
there is no noise or hum . 
it works and i like . 
i 'm a keyboard player , and in the past i had been spending $ 40 - $ 60 for monster 's `` delegated '' keyboard cables . 
but suddenly one shorted out on me after only several months use , causing me to question the `` monster mystique . '' 
i began to compare the monster keyboard cables with cheap , `` off-brand '' guitar cables and could n't hear any difference . 
no question it 's a well-made , trustworthy -lrb- but not indestructible or infallible -rrb- cable , but i 'm no longer committed to it at any price . 
however , at amazon 's current `` value '' price for this particular monster cable , it 's a no-brainer . 
moreover , i no longer have hesitations about purchasing a cable that does n't say `` piano '' or `` keyboard '' on it . 
-lrb- one of my monster keyboard cables even came with one end designated for the amp and the other for the instrument -- but it was hard to see which was which in a dimly lit club . -rrb- 
as for length , 6 feet is ideal if you 're playing through your own amp -lrb- my preference -rrb- . 
if you 're plugging into a board or p.a. system , you 'll want anywhere from 12 feet to 25 feet . 
this cable works fine , i 'm going to buy a pair in january 2013 . 
i used it live and they are really great , durable and it feel 's pro . 
try one . 
this string set offers typical d'addario quality and value . 
i use d'addario strings on all my guitars , mandos and my ancient old fiddle . 
d'addario prelude violin string set , 4/4 scale , medium tension is good deal for beginners . 
it 's good enough , not expensive . 
try it till you ready to by more expensive string . 
um , if you 're looking for budget violin strings , then you probably are n't playing principle violin in the new york philharmonic . 
me neither . 
i 'm an abhorrent violinist , but i teach mariachi band to elementary school students . 
on my el cheapo violin , these strings sound quite nice . 
i would give them 5 stars , but i think that would be overselling them a bit . 
they 're fine . 
if you 're looking for 5 star strings , you 're going to have to pay more-and ask someone who plays better than i do to review them for you . 
the best part of this pick is that it is easier on my strings , it still gives the pick tone , but seems to do less damage . 
i usually play my jazz bass fingerstyle , but there are songs where i prefer a pick , especially when i need speed and accuracy . 
until i found the hard wedgie rubber pick , i used a heavy fender pick , but did n't like the sharp pick sound very much.i bought a set of soft , medium and hard wedgie picks to try out and i 'm really happy with the results . 
i greatly prefer the soft wedgie on the uke , i like the medium on my nylon string guitar and the hard wedgie 's really nice for my jazz bass . 
i still use hard plastic picks for my electric and steel string acoustic guitars , but the wedgie 's are fantastic for when i need a more fingerlike sound on the other instruments . 
i prefer the 3.1 mm wedgie picks since the 5mm picks feel a bit too thick for my tastes , but that 's entirely subjective.i 'd love to see a slightly larger version of the pick someday , but it still works very well for me . 
this is a fun pick . 
i play a lot with my fingers and thumb and thought i 'd give this a try . 
its great ! 
i love the tone of this pick striking strings . 
i love the way it transmits the feel of the strings . 
more organic than plastic picks . 
yes it might crumble on you if you play too hard . 
i think if you play as hard with this pick as you would with your thumb you 'll be fine . 
its a lot of fun and for such a little price can open your playing to different tones for your instrument . 
worth a try . 
these picks do cut pick noise but with an acoustic guitar they wear very rapidly and leave a rubbery residue all over my guitar . 
i do n't like the thought of what damage that stuff would do over time to the inside of my guitar with that stuff getting all over my pickups , etc. . 
big disappointment . 
i 'm getting a lot of high string in my guitar sound and thought these picks might solve the problem . 
back to the drawing board i go . 
you ca n't have too many adapters if you are a sound guy . 
this handy gadget converts a balanced or unbalanced mic cable to an unbalanced 1/4 '' jack . 
simple and it works . 
i 've got a couple in my kit and they do what they say and come in handy when working with unknown equipment . 
i see mixed reviews here . 
at this price , no telling what the quality control is like but as i wrote in another review on this type of item , you can buy 3 of these and if one fails , you 're still ahead of the game . 
they 're so much less expensive than what one will typically find in a guitar or electronics store , well worth taking a chance . 
mine seems to be fine , does n't look or feel flimsy at all . 
i ca n't see any difference between this and what i buy in a retail package . 
if you find yourself in need of a desk mount for your microphone , this one works well . 
it is heavy enough to keep the microphone from tipping over , and the black anodized stem gives a subtle appearance on the desk . 
having the microphone always plugged in , accessible on the desk and ready to go means i save much setup time for my voice-over work . 
i bought this for my m-audio keyboard but it also works equally well with my casio lighted keyboard.just be sure that your keyboard has a sustain pedal connection.this is a very heavy duty unit that feels and operates exactly like the sustain peddle on a piano . 
a well built pedal of good quality , with enough weight to keep the body stable , and a good &#34; middle of the travel &#34; execution point for sustain . 
with the correct keyboard , the pedal will also allow for half pedaling . 
** very important to someone who has keyboards from multiple manufacturers , especially older models ; this pedal does has a switch to allow for polarity adjustment -lrb- for most newer keyboards this does n't matter , as polarity can be edited globally , or , alternatively , polarity is sensed on startup so long as the pedal is plugged in -rrb- some other pedals , particularly those from name manufacturers , will only work with some keyboards . 
that said , i feel this m-audio compares favorably to it 's most visible competition , yamaha 's fc4 offering . 
the yamaha pedal is a bit heavier , which i do like and subjectively implies better quality , but , in reality , the yamaha did not last under the same circumstances , breaking down and needing a spot repair after a year on the road . 
last , the yamaha fc4 does not have the half pedaling option or polarity switch , making this m-audio pedal a great all around option.in my case , this pedal has been on the live stage , unpacked and packed , tossed around a fair bit , for 2 1/2 years with no problems . 
there is n't much to say other than if you are a keyboardist , and are in need of a durable , high quality sustain pedal , buy this pedal ! 
beautiful pedal , nice chrome foot piece , weighted so as to have a substantial feel , quiet , and rubber bottom so as not to slip around . 
an all-around solid purchase for the low price i found on amazon . 
love it . 
this thing is awesome ! 
really nice looking , and heavy duty . 
costs a few bucks , but is very high quality , seems like it will last for ever . 
after reading the reviews , i expected the leather to be a tougher than it is . 
it 's soft without being limp . 
there 's no break-in time required . 
i bought this for my tele and it looks ans feels great . 
i like to keep a pre-adjusted strap in each guitar case , and i 'm planning to buy another one of these for my martin . 
love the looks , it does what i need , holds guitar , looks great , priced right , anyone thinking of one should get it!great service when ordered ! 
i liked the strap , used it for many years and it held up great . 
the texture almost looks fake though . 
i 've been recording professionally for 27 years ; music , radio commercials and television mostly . 
so i 'll try to give you the information you need to make your purchase.i 've owned and used so many mics and brands through the years i ca n't remember them all but i can i say i 've never had a bad a-t . 
4033 's , 4050 's and 4080 's i use every week and have for years , the 4033 going back to the mid 90 's and the 2020 is just a lower priced electret condenser from the a-t family . 
you have no idea the % of recordings that you 're hearing this brand on , it 's used by almost every studio on every continent , i work in the us , italy to scotland and can attest to this . 
but first let me tell you , very simply , where the negative reviewers went wrong.this is a xlr connection phantom powered mic , which is pro and best . 
so it requires a phantom powered xlr input , which all pro equipment provides and is standard on most home recording audio interfaces . 
which you should really purchase along with this , if you have n't already , because for around $ 100 you 'll improve your recording and playback and have a preamp and monitoring , you 'll find one by searching audio interfaces . 
i have a rolandroland tri capture audio interfaceand a focusrite i use just for playback in my office and den but they work well and you do n't need avid hd 's to get started . 
audio interface is just another name for an external sound card but will provide the proper input and gain meter . 
getting your interface away from the electronically noisy computer has been sop since the dawn of digital . 
i see that small usb mixers are available which would be another option . 
do n't try an adapter on it , it wo n't work , as this needs power through the cord to charge the field affect transistor , but power supplies are available and after that adapt however you want . 
it does n't come with the cord , what a surprise ! 
quality cords will cost about half the price of this , but a $ 15 version will probably do for most.it does n't come with ashock mountbut you can purchase one if you like . 
work with it , you may not need one and the recorded vibrations rumbling will tell you that you do . 
you 'll need a windscreen and a popper stopper typeshure popper stopper pop filteris the usual , but i can also recommend using 2 large $ 1.49 foam screens with the top cut from one as this mic is side address and you will need to cover the entire screen . 
this is n't about being cheap , there are times that the goosenecks are very inconvenient and do n't work at strange angles and you 'll probably always need one or the other.this does not come with a stand , so pick up a boom stand if you do n't have one and pay no attention that the negative reviewers will tell you they tip over , 18 wheelers also tip over.recommendeduse a sandbag or whatever on the leg opposite the mic or remove the boom and top portion and slide on a barbell weight and put it back together or create a proper counterweight where they 've put a faux plastic one . 
if it 's possible , you could mount a boom from the ceiling and run the cable on hooks , eliminating vibration from the floor while keeping the cable out the waymicrophone flange male . 
for desktop users , here 's what i 'd do . 
using large command strips and velcro i 'd fasten this to the deskadjustable desk microphone standand attach thistelescoping mini-boomhere 's another optionmxl mics mxl-bcd-standunderstand that recording has progressed by meeting needs and experimenting , if you need something figure it out , your clean , quiet recording is proof that it works.i ca n't justify comparing this to my $ 500 to $ 4000 mics like it but if there is a better value buy it . 
$ 82 would n't have bought a case for most of my condensers . 
it sure beats most non electret , electrostatic dc bias or dynamic style mics . 
the 2020 is certainly an entry level professional mic and in many situations could be substituted for a 4033 without issue . 
also individual mics have a sound , of the eight 4033 's i have , i prefer 3 of them and use them the most . 
so when reviewers say it 's bright , i say compared to what ? 
i can tell you what it sounds like.....ka-ching ! 
a great sound in audio recording . 
uh huh , i know of one professional recording it 's on and the client was clueless that i used an $ 82 mic . 
think about it , would this be as good as what was used 40 years ago ? 
have you heard good 70 's recordings ? 
anyone purchasing equipment because it `` sounds '' better ought to have earned enough to slap down cash to pay for it . 
lot 's of reviewers have opinions about this mic so do n't ignore them but ask yourself this , do they have formal training and experience with 200 different mics in many studios and are they using expensive gear from their console to their monitors to reveal its true capabilities ? 
any noticeable increase in sound quality might cost $ 400 and wo n't be half of what you 'll achieve by improving your recording technique.this type of mic is excellent for overhead , acoustics , amps or brass and of course vocals , really most recording needs , having a less uni and more omni , cardioid directional pattern than stage mics hyper pattern it 's better suited to recording . 
just understand you ca n't get too loud near it or you 'll overdrive it since it 's designed for up to screaming vocals , so back off with loud amps and brass , which also means you need a quiet place for recording because it 'll pick up your ac ducts and your neighbor 's tv . 
that , is a good thing , what 's bad is you trying to do good recording in a noisy environment , so do n't blame a mic for your extraneous room noise . 
you ca n't just use a different microphone or noise gates or processors of any kind , just quiet , anything else is a pail on a sinking ship because this is an acoustical , rather than electronic , signal to noise ratio . 
a 10db pad will reduce output but does n't effect the diaphragm and its input and acoustical foam wo n't help , that 's not even its purpose , i suggest reading this on acoustics and foam , music.tutsplus dot com/tutorials/beginners-guide-to - acoustic-treatment -- audio-1274 -lrb- just replace the -lsb- dot -rsb- -rrb- . 
turn off your heat/air , be careful of headphone bleed and do your recording between 3 and 5 am , when the world 's a quieter place and that will really help , you 'll likely hear how loud your computer fans are . 
you can get underground in your basement or build blanket walls , or buy used office partitions but you need quiet , i 've known acoustic players who 've worn gas masks to cut the sound of their breathing . 
if this is what your budget allows for it 's an excellent first step into recording and this type of mic and likely this brand would be my first choice for a first recording mic no matter the cost . 
i keep saying `` this type of mic '' and the reason why is because a-t sells 14 models like this style up to $ 3000 . 
this model is the lowest priced but you 're buying a reputable brand . 
if your future plans include using only one mic , without the ability to use any traditional recording hardware , you can look here.audio-technica at2020 usb condenser usb microphoneor hereaudio technica at2020usb + cardioid condenser microphone w/pop filterthis is not my advise , you will also lose the higher quality playback and the supplied recording software that comes with an interface . 
this model is not usb.now pay no attention to the descriptions of how it sounds , i wo n't tell you because how it sounds to me on my system wo n't apply to you and your system and that goes for all audio , descriptions are worthless , only unplugging one piece of gear for another matters . 
this is important , all audio equipment either accurately reproduces or does n't , the recording can not sound better than the source , so a microphone can only reproduce sound more or less accurate than a different microphone . 
accurate or inaccurate , not good or bad , there 's a difference . 
it 's during the mix that you make it better or different from the original sound . 
apply these same thoughts to your home stereo , saying instead , playback can not sound better than the recording and that 's why accuracy is important in your monitors.so search out any info you do n't understand and do n't expect to be a competent engineer without years of schooling , training and having worked in a professional setting . 
if you 're lucky like i was , after 1 year of tech school i worked on site repair -lrb- studios often need pt -rrb- and apprenticed while continuing my education for the next 3 , then after 3 years of work -lrb- tv -rrb- with another year of school i became a studio owner . 
real recording involves a facility , equipment and techniques as involved as a surgeon in a hospital . 
so study electronics , acoustics , the auditory cortex , everything audio , train yourself to hear the smallest sounds all day , it never stops . 
when making any purchases i recommend reading and research and realize this is a tool and because you can buy a tool does n't mean you 're educated in its use . 
so yes , i also do n't recommend buying a scalpel and trying surgery on your little brother , unless ... but everyone of us started somewhere so get some equipment and start recording , quit all that sleeping , eating and other unnecessary activities and just read and record ! 
just short sessions at a real studio will also open your eyes and be educational and some will allow you to just stop in and talk , i have . 
so keep up the research because no man knows it all and i 'm just here to help you out . 
if you need a good , small , inexpensive stereo amp check this one out . 
topping tp22 digital mini amplifier this mike is a great way to start recording at home . 
i use it with a small behringer mixer and garageband on my mac and just having a ball . 
i know its not the nice wiz bang high dollar type and maybe their are others just as good for the price . 
however , i find the mic being real step up from using dynamic mikes for recording at home . 
great price for good mike . 
i did not want to spend a lot to start . 
i got a good mike at a great price -lrb- $ 50 -rrb- whatever good things you 've heard about the at2020 is probably true ! 
well . . 
unless if you 've heard it will sprout wings and save you if you falling from the sky ... but it sounds great when your recording songs ! 
haha ! 
i record with fl studio and it 's even great so far ! 
i recommend you get this !! 
this was exactly what i needed for the price range i could afford in a crunch . 
my old mic just was n't cutting it going into my computers usb audio interface.there are nice changes in sound texture from different angles . 
it is really sensitive to pop and breath so a pop filter is critical for vocals . 
it is recording my guitar beautifully.i 've even been able to record nice quick tracks for copyright recordings of both my voice and guitar . 
i 've set the stand low and angled the mic towards the guitars sound hole -lrb- slightly back -rrb- and sing into the top at about 45 degrees and back a little . 
i found a quick comfortable balance and the result is warm and clean.i 'm very happy with this unit -lrb- price considered but i 'd have to pay a lot more to improved on it -rrb- . 
i 'll probably get another one . 
i kind of wish i 'd have bought that combo kit . 
i use this at home for rough tracks and have also used it at work for voice over . 
its worked great . 
very happy with it . 
its not a $ 2000 quality mic but it its a good mic for the money . 
some of the tone can be a little tricky sometimes , but for the price its expected to not have it sound like butter . 
i bought this as a gift for a friend he was really happy with it but , i have a completely different view . 
the at2020 is a pretty bright mic which sounds good at first but once you layer tracks on top of each other it can sound very harsh . 
second it is not a true large diaphragm condenser . 
it is a very good mic for people starting out in music or just using it for podcasts , but there are a bunch of better mics near this price . 
two that come to mind are the mxl v67g and studio projects b1 -lrb- stay away from the studio projects c1 -rrb- both exceptional microphones for the price . 
although there is one mic you that is a bit more expensive but is absolutely amazing , the mxl 2003a . 
a lot of people have claimed the studio projects c1 sounds like the neumann u87 it does n't , the mxl 2003a however sounds very similar and is easily the best ldc mic under $ 500 . 
with that being said the at2020 is not a bad microphone but it is not great , to people who have just used built in mics on there computer or camera this will blow them away but as time goes on they will learn the limitations of this microphone.although to be fair i have a lot of experience in pro audio and production , so i maybe a bit overly critical . 
one thing is for sure though ; there are definitely better mics in or near this price range . 
this fog machine puts out a good amount of fog but it takes several minutes to warm up . 
the fog dissipates pretty quickly and the machine has a hard time keeping up to keep the room foggy . 
it 's ok but not the best fog machine out there . 
great device and good price ... my wife made me try this for a gig we had ... it worked great ! 
i love the foggy affect on stage , with a touch of lighting it really comes to life.the fog juice this thing comes with has a funky scent though . 
perhaps it might be wise to get some scent thingie to toss in the tank with the juice . 
i do n't know if the other brands of fog juice smells weird also but i have another can of juice i bought to use later . 
i will report on that ... i gave it 5 stars although the fog juice is funky because it 's not the fog juice that matters , it 's how the machine works ... it does what it should do . 
dont use the cheap fog liquid as it smells bad and gums up the system if you leave it in too long.i got this last year for a small party and had the smoke alarm going off in my basement within seconds . 
this beast puts out lots of fog and does a nice job.it does get hot and drips at the front if you spray for too long but it does do what it 's supposed to . 
also note that the cap on the machine does n't seal well and will drip if you angle the unit too much.keep it away from walls and floors as the oil will collect on them and leave you with a mess to clean up later . 
it 's best on a stand 3-4 feet off the ground.overall build quality is very nice . 
metal case , compact , nice bracket , lighted remote telling you when it 's ready.the threads on the tank are plastic as is the cap and can be damaged if you cross thread which is quite easy ... recieved this item today in preparations for a halloween party , upon installation and testing , the unit blew a fuse . . 
going to buy another fuse to see if it was a random thing , if not , i 'll be returning mine . . 
will update ... update . . 
radio shack carries the correct fuses for this unit , upon changing the fuse the unit works as expected . . 
leaks a bit while using , so dont stand under it ... but most on these things leak anyway . . 
good quality and does n't cost very much . 
the price is great too . 
glad i bought it . 
folds up well . 
has a black finish on it . 
the material it 's made of is good , and it holds the guitar . 
the only things i do n't like are 2.1 -rrb- each of the corners has a cap . 
the one at the bottom where you actually put the guitar it comes off .2 -rrb- the part at the bottom that looks like a u -lrb- used to hold the guitar -rrb- it spins ... it means that there is nothing like a bolt or a screw to make it stay still , so every time you try to put your guitar on you have to make sure to put that straight.i would suggest to but a more expensive model or a totally different one . 
in life you mostly get what you pay for . 
this stand really is n't an exception . 
getting what you pay for though does n't mean that it wo n't do what you need it to do . 
this stand is light weight and inexpensive because of it . 
the great thing is , it does n't need to be any heavier or needlessly fancy to do exactly what it needs to do . 
it 's a great choice for someone looking to keep their guitars from becoming damaged while they sit out waiting to be played . 
even though they will not get damaged while laying around they are still easily accessible for you to play as opposed to having them stored in a case.for $ 10 a pop you can afford to have one for every guitar . 
putting them on display and allowing them to be handy when the urge strikes you to play . 
you now have no excuse for your expensive -lrb- or cheap -rrb- guitar to get beat up from laying around . 
it 's really hard to beat this product for the price . 
i found it sturdy , well built , and a great fit for my guitar . 
i really appreciate the low , wide stance , which is great insurance against accident prone guitar players such as myself ! 
it 's semi-secure on carpeting or hard floor , but all together i am pretty unsatisfied with this stand . 
the bottom piece has no way to lock in place , and although with the guitar on it it is more stable , i am not comfortable enough risking my wonderful guitar to something rather flimsy ... i prefer the one that is mounted on the wall as more stable overall . 
this one ? 
meh . 
not worth the purchase in my opinion ... booooooooo . 
better than i expect , , , i going to order 2 more ... very stable , , easy to assemble and a nice price . . 
tubulaarrrrholds my 8 string , 6 string , acoustic , etc.has held up very sturdily over the year i 've had it or so and works well for it . 
my only concern is that the shaft that holds the weight is plastic and not metal . 
i do n't know how long it will last . 
i might find a tube to place over it and make a lager hole . 
but the price is right and the stand is solid enough . 
all areas that touch the banjo or guitar are protected and should last . 
it came and it was n't broken or bad and it held my brother 's guitar for a few years until he sold it simple , no frills , stand . 
only problem i 've had lately is that the velveteen padding on top seems to get loose and keeps coming off . 
a lil ' glue will fix it , just have n't had time ! 
this is basically the same as the other stand i rated , just from a different manufacturer . 
same basic materials , you ca n't go wrong with either . 
see my other review for the world tour gs-1 folding tripod guitar stand . 
honestly , i ca n't tell them apart since i threw out the boxes . 
easy to take apart , to put together , to store , and pretty stable when in use . 
not the cheapest but worth the money . 
on stage xcg4 tubular guitar stand with velveteen padding and security is very helpful tool for any guitarist.i got a lot of them for my guitar collection and have no complain.recommend it . 
i paid 10 dollars for this . 
it must be giving me cancer in the state of california because it 's not cheap at all . 
folds up for transport , works great on hardwood floors , padded where it needs to be , and has a strap so it does n't fall forward either . 
angle of the feet might be too shallow for carpet , look for something where the legs ` enter ' the carpet more straight down . 
i am a novice musician so perhaps my lack of experience in these items . 
once you figure out how it goes together it is an excellent product . 
it holds your guitar up . 
this is more of a like it or hate kind of item . 
if it does n't work , you hate it . 
if it works , there 's nothing impressive about a stand , so i just like it . 
this stand gets a lot of use from me and holds up great . 
i 'm going to be switching to a 7 stand rack soon for all my basses but i will still keep this around because it holds up well . 
love the all black look as well . 
works good , nothing special . 
i have to say i disagree with a couple of reviews which complained about a bad smell . 
my big nose ca n't confirm that . 
maybe they corrected the problem if one exited . 
cant b beat for the cost . 
it does jusy exactly whats expected . 
and at 10 bucks its woth every penny i have just receive mine just now . . 
it was awesome ... i never thought that it would be so solid ... it is made with steel and covered with rubber on the very edge . . 
ca n't beat the price ... i would recommend this to anybody who are looking for a guitar stand !! . . 
a + + + most guitar shapes and sizes fit on this guitar stand , it is easy to assemble and theres really not much to it but the fact that its a guitar stand , nothing special about it . 
i use these on my hofner and gibson es-135 . 
they sound amazing and feel fantastic . 
these will be the only strings to go on my jazz guitars from now on . 
i bought my first set of these strings about two years ago and havent looked back since . 
awesome feel , sound and price . 
just the right thickness for playing all the classic rock and acoustic stuff that i do . 
i know they are electric strings but they do sound nice when playing acoustically written songs on my strat . 
one thing i notice with these is that they seem to sound new a lot longer than others i have tried . 
thats nice . 
i had put these on , and my wife picked my guitar to play , and she was confused.they do take some time getting used to . 
they do n't rip up your hand as much , and if you keep your fingers on the strings as you shift , there is less friction . 
this is good , but it takes some getting used to . 
i used that finger-tip friction to let me know where i was on the fretboard . 
with these , i found myself over-shifting both high and low.i like them , and they sound nice , but i bought some round wounds to replace these when the time comes . 
i like a mellow sound with a smooth feel . 
these strings are what i needed and they perform.d ` addario ecg23 chromes flat wound electric guitar have these on my tele , very interesting to play around with . 
i bought the regular gauge first and usually use pink slinkeys on all my electrics , the regular chromes where like telephone wires compared to my regular gauge so i bought these instead . 
these were a lot easier to play and more like my slinkeys . 
they still are heavier and you can really feel it when bending but they add a completely different feel to playing guitar and your tone . 
when playing these i tend to play more sixties inspired , the flats help capture that surf guitar tone which is really cool . 
i really like them but they are completely different and i would n't recommend them to everyone . 
as far as cq goes these are great , no problems , feel great , sound great . 
i 've used a few different strap lock systems and this is by far my favorite design -lrb- not to mention the most affordable which must be due to its simplicity -rrb- . 
to use these , you put your strap on your guitar -lrb- as usual -rrb- then put the locks on . 
rotate the smaller piece until the holes line up then slide the lock on above the strap . 
once the lock has passed the head of the guitar 's strap button , rotate the smaller piece again until the holes do not line up -lrb- close position -rrb- which should be about 180 degrees from open position . 
very simple and works very well.i have not used any lock system that 's perfect . 
every one that i 've used failed at one point or another -lrb- came off unexpectedly -rrb- . 
these work exceptionally well . 
what i like about this design is that it does n't require any modifications on the guitar or the strap . 
you can use the strap you like without adding anything to it and you do n't have to replace the guitar 's existing strap buttons.but they do stick out a bit -lrb- to keep the strap from sliding off -rrb- so if you 're concerned about looks , you might want to try another system that 's more discreet . 
also , i tend to use thinner leather straps that have thinner ends . 
these will likely not work very well with thicker straps that tend to take up most of the height of most strap buttons . 
it 's an ok product for the price but they are weak and with a very small amount of force they will pop off . 
does n't color the sound , depending on how you 're using it you can push the channel or get an extra channel . 
i 've turned a two channel amp into four with this puppy !! 
i replaced the nasty , crooked , chipping plastic pins for these , and they work very well in keeping the strings where they should be . 
i 'm not convinced that they change the sound of my d-28 very much for better or worse . 
i replaced one pin at a time and compared strings and really could n't tell much of a difference , still they are better to handle and remove than the nasty plastic ones , so i consider them an upgrade . 
sound quality did improve over the plastic pegs . 
next in line is to tweak my bridge by replacing the plastic saddle with a tusq . 
this should improve my sustain and tone even more . 
if you 're looking for a budget increase of tone ... this is a way to go . 
these are slightly larger diameter than the original pins were . 
this is exactly what i wanted since my 1973 acoustic guitar has been restrung so many times that the bridge pin holes were getting loose enough that the original plastic pins were very low and difficult to grab and pull out . 
these new pins fit those holes perfectly and make stringing my guitar a pleasure , again ! 
and there is also a noticeable improvement in the sound , over that produced by the plastic pins . 
i ordered three of these ... so far!very affordable and good quality . 
made in canada.keeps wireless unit very snug and tight.easy in and out with velcro retaining strap . 
-lrb- all leather . -rrb- 
i use the little plastic flat ring on the bottom to loop my strap through which keeps it tight against the guitar strap.the width of the slots are 1 inch and 1/16 &#34; or approximately 27 mm wide . 
the leather will bend a little to allow a slightly larger and tighter fit.these are much better than i suspected and have a few expensive levy 's classic padded straps . 
they fit each other like a glove and are very high quality without getting ridiculous or gawdy.if you click on the item and go to the product page i have uploaded some photos of actual use and close-ups . 
i like it that it fits well on my strap and that it has a good snug hold on the receiver great use to hold a guitar pick and to use to find your keys to open the door with.my son likes it and uses it often i clip this pick holder to my music stand and it 's always handy , and very easy to use . 
i use thin picks and was able to fit four of them into this holder . 
i have owned my g7th capo over a year now & as far as i 'm concerned it beats all the others i 've owned in the past hands down !! 
so easy to use & can clamp right on my guitar nut for ease of moving when needed . 
i bought this capo thinking it would look slicker without the clamp handles sticking out but what i found is that although it looks cool , it 's complicated -lrb- which for a capo is saying something -rrb- . 
the release lever makes it difficult to get a good amount of pressure on the strings and nearly impossible to put it at the top of the guitar when not in use.bottom line : if you do n't mind the extra effort and do n't plan on keeping it on your guitar when not using , then maybe you will enjoy it . 
for everyone else , look elsewhere . 
i bought this because after i rebuilt a guitar that was very special to me it would n't stay in tune . 
i took it to a number of guys thinking i did something wrong in the build and was just overlooking it . 
i use a capo a lot so when someone recommended this ... i thought they were crazy . 
i 'm not paying that much for a capo and i doubt that is the problem . 
well ... i broke down and i 'm glad i did . 
this thing is amazing . 
it solved the problem because i can set the tension and the design make it sit just right on my strat . 
spend the money ... it 's worth it . 
only con is that it takes some practice to change it quickly . 
as musicians , sometimes we find just the right sound or feel with a piece of equipment and it changes everything taking our performance to a new level . 
for me it happened when i found just the right sound & feel from my taylor acoustic guitar , the right vocal mics , the right mixer , my bose l1 model ii , etc.today i had one of those finds . 
after years of being somewhat dissatisfied with every capo i 've encountered i discovered the perfect capo for me : the g7th performance capo . 
i 'm not kidding - it was one of those finds . 
as an acoustic guitar player / vocalist , obviously , i have to play all of my songs in the right key for an optimum vocal performance . 
this means occasionally relying on a capo to get just the right key with just the right chord shape/structure . 
unfortunately , some of my songs had `` weak '' spots -lrb- sending them to my `` b '' list -rrb- courtesy of the combination of a `` weaker '' chord for me -lrb- due to physical limitations -rrb- & the reduced sustain & tonal quality resulting from using a capo . 
this dissatisfaction has had me on a `` capo quest '' which ended today when i found the g7th performance capo.the first thing i noticed when i used the g7th was the improved sustain over every other capo i 've used . 
all of those `` weak '' spots in my songs totally disappeared . 
i quickly dusted off several songs that were on my `` b '' list & found the improved sustain & tonal quality aloud me to move them to my `` a '' list.i have no problem with the weight of this capo -lrb- others have pointed out that it is heavier -rrb- i ca n't detect any change in balance when handling my guitar -lrb- i play sitting on a guitar stool with the guitar resting on my leg - perhaps someone standing using a guitar strap might notice a slight difference in the balance . -rrb- 
i love the `` self-ratcheting '' feature of the g7th . 
i thought from some reviews & videos i watched that i 'd have to pinch-down on the open end fairly firmly for a secure hold - this was not the case . 
i think the g7th has just the right width & density of foam under the top bar : a -rrb- providing more `` friction '' to hold this capo in place ; b -rrb- playing a role in very effectively dampening the strings ; & c -rrb- possibly being more gentle on the strings than a more narrow/harder foam or rubber top bar , thus having less impact on tuning.i did find one slight negative about this capo which i was able to quickly overcome . 
the end of the top metal bar -lrb- on the open end of capo -rrb- is slightly more `` squared-off '' than the end of the bottom piece -lrb- which in contrast is rounded off -rrb- . 
it may be just the way i play some chords , but my hand was contacting that squared-off end of the top bar & was getting irritated - so i simply turned the capo around with the open end facing me -lrb- versus facing the floor -rrb- & the surfaces contacting my hand were far smoother - thus , zero irritation . 
this was nothing new to me - i have had to do this with other capos.others have commented on the cost of this capo . 
for me , the cost of this capo was nothing compared to the many thousands of dollars i 've spent finding just the right guitars , pa 's , mics , & other equipment / accessories . 
i almost ca n't believe it only cost me $ 40 to make such a difference in my sound . 
the g7th performance capo is priceless !!! 
overall , i highly recommend this capo - if you 're like me - this could be a very inexpensive way to take your performance to the next level !!! 
i 'm a strong believer in having back-ups for critical components so i will immediately purchase another g7th as a back-up -lrb- maybe i 'll order the black or gold & use my silver one as the back-up -rrb- . 
we bought this rack tray for our son 's new sound rack . 
it is solid , and mounts easily to the front rails on the cabinet . 
it is a short shelf , so it only goes about half-way to the back of the rack cabinet . 
he uses it to hold his wireless receiver for his guitar amp , along with other miscellaneous things he keeps in the cabinet . 
a great deal here on amazon , these cost a lot more a few years ago , it appears chief bought raxxess and is now doing the manufacturing . 
the shelf i received has slots all over it -lrb- instead of a bunch of screw holes -rrb- , this makes it really easy to mount things . 
i 'm ordering more of these , they are thick metal and strong enough to hold heavy gadgets.good luck and good music to all . 
i bought these to replace the stock machine heads that came on my hondo ii `` the paul '' , which i bought in 1980 . 
the stock ones were loose , lots of backlash in the worm gears , and the guitar kept going out of tune even after the strings were fairly stretched out but still new.they went in easily , if you follow this hint -lrb- if your machine head holes do not need to be enlarged , disregard this hint -rrb- - the holes for the old machine heads on the hondo ii were 0.305 '' in diameter , and these new grovers need a 0.390 '' diameter hole . 
so i had to find an accurate and clean way of enlarging the holes . 
it 's almost impossible to use a drill , even in a drill press , without splintering the wood on both surfaces of the headstock . 
i read online suggestions about using a round wood file , and reamer , etc. . 
so what i did was first use a threading tap -lrb- for metal screw threads -rrb- which at the bottom had a 0.290 '' diameter , and at the top had a 0.375 '' diameter . 
this is a standard 3/8 '' -24 threading tap . 
i chucked the tap into my battery-powered hand drill , set to low speed , and used the threading tap to cleanly and carefully enlarge the headstock holes to 0.375 '' in diameter . 
then i used a tapered reamer , from both sides , to enlarge the holes to the required diameter . 
quick , clean , easy . 
if you have a different size enlargement to make , use the appropriately sized taps and a tapered reamer to get the holes to 0.390 '' diameter.another hint which you should follow is to replace only one machine head at a time , like when changing strings . 
you do n't want to take the tension off the neck and mess around with the truss rod . 
at least i do n't want to!now the guitar stays in tune , and is easier and more accurate to tune.a very worthwhile upgrade ! 
zero backlash in the worm gears on the grovers , beautifully chromed and smooth as silk . 
this guitar strap is very comfortable and was easy to fit onto my electric yamaha guitar.very durable and affordable.my only gripe is that the color doesnt match my guitar as well as i thought it would.colors are abit too flashy . 
i bought this with super saver shipping 5-8 days and it came in 3 so i was very happy about that . 
also the lightning itself looks awesome and the black in the background is darker in person than in the -lrb- low quality -rrb- picture . 
one more thing is that the strap locks on very well by it self -lrb- i have a big problem with that because the strap that came with my guitar sucked -rrb- but hell this one is amazing . 
i bought this one for my black fender and i think i 'm going to buy a white tribal for my white ibanez grg120bdx . 
great product cant go wrong especially with the double sided design and the price . 
good value put these on my prs se 245 and i love em . 
i can restring in a matter of a minute or maybe 2 . 
they were a perfect fit . 
no problems whatsoever . 
i 'm happy with this . 
used it to replace the blown speaker from a 30 yr . 
old 60w roland cube amp -lrb- a bass player used the amp and i think it was too much for the speaker -- next time i 'll use the pa for the bass player -rrb- . 
much better sound , perfect fit , etc. . 
keep in mind this is for a very clean sound and this speaker was recommended for its clean and somewhat smokey-type sound . 
i believe it has those . 
using this for jazz applications and having the roland around as a second amp . 
our family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist switched to these style locks about a year ago . 
every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body . 
i had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th anniversary american p-bass ... not good . 
my son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekend.the problem with the design is there 's a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that 's screwed into the body unscrewing itself . 
we 've tried applying bar soap , petro jelly , and a spray can based dry lubricant ... . 
none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon.we are switching to the dunlop style locks as that design incorporates ball bearings which allows the strap to rotate freely back and forth with next to zero ` unscrewing ' force.we tried to make the shallers work but just could not . 
maybe we 're all too active on stage but we can not tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us . 
i 've been using the schaller strap locks on my guitars since the 1980 's . 
they give me a sense of security , knowing that my guitar strap is totally secured to my guitar . 
i consider it cheap insurance . 
this is my second set of these . 
i bought the 1st set in the 1980 's and i 'm still using them on the guitar that they matched . 
-lrb- black hardware -rrb- . 
i was impressed with the quality of the 1st set and the 2nd set is just as good . 
money well spent . 
i have found that everything schaller make 's is grade a - # 1 in my book . 
made in germany -lrb- not china -rrb- these locks are fast and secure . 
i like the way they slide on & off which if your like me having to change guitar 's during a show or just at home , the change is smooth and safe . 
no dropping guitar 's around here !!! 
i have them on all my guitar 's . 
these locks are the only ones i use now , they are on all of my guitars and i put them on all i build . 
i have not had a guitar drop since i started using them , and have not read of anyone else having one drop either if it was attached . 
i have tried the fender lock recently and although it is a great lock it is too large for me and my schaller equipped straps will not fit them . 
i will stick with the schaller in all 3 colors . 
i will let you know that i 've been using boom stands for 35 years and that i write this so you can make an informed decision . 
i 'm loyal to the audio community and the industry has already put one of my kids through college.i see half of this stand as being just fine but the boom is not very good . 
i particularly do n't think the horizontal axis point is very good , i mean where you adjust the angle of the boom . 
it 's a cheap version of a simple design and i suspect the day will come that you 're trying to figure how to keep it from drooping , the problem being that the surface area is much smaller creating less friction and more tightening until something 's got to give . 
the tightening screws to slide it also seem pretty poor and i 'd predict someday you 'll be going from duct tape to replacing it . 
i base this more on my experience in sound reinforcement , which is harder on equipment than recording and because i own both types of businesses . 
the boom in general is n't a nice one and will always be 32 inches because it is n't telescoping and uses a pretend plastic counterweight , so you 're mainly purchasing the stand . 
on stage has a better line they call the 9700 vs this 7700 series .9701 b pro tripod microphone boom standjust like you ca n't compare the price of a used compact car with a new full size pickup , this one is so inexpensive -lrb- too inexpensive ? -rrb- 
that price comparisons are n't what 's important , so looking at amazon today i 'd probably buy the 9700ms9701tb teleboom microphone standor this one , dr pro mic stand telescoping boomor maybe try this onehosa msb-521bk mic stand with boomi have n't tried that stand but since hosa generally sells good inexpensive products i 'd be inclined to give it a try . 
i think you 'll end up spending more money on your next stand and you might as well do it once instead of twice . 
i 'd pay attention to the 2 and 3 star reviews because you 'll find more from experienced users and the most helpful 5 star do not say how long they 've been using it but love how inexpensive it is . 
ignore that it does n't come with a mic clip because usually they do n't , clips come with microphones or can be purchased separately . 
all but the best stands will fall over when unbalanced , so plan on putting weight on a leg if you 're using a heavy mic like a condenser or spending a lot more money . 
$ 100 + will buy you a studio boom although a counterweight , like what 's used on a cymbal boom will help any boom stand and could be created with a little imagination . 
as for the cheap cord clips , just forget them and buy these , they 'll attach to a stand or cord and work excellent -lrb- no leftover duct tape glue -rrb- . 
velcro reusable self-gripping tiesbut understand my position , i 've got stands purchased 20 years ago that i can still use and do n't feel the lowest price is always the best value , but you 're intelligent so you know an $ 80 stand used for 20 years is $ 4/year , i use stands almost everyday and i do n't think this would last me a year and maybe only months . 
but if1 . 
you do n't care about a telescoping boom and2 . 
you do n't plan to adjust it much and3 . 
you use a average weight mic or4 . 
you 're alright with replacing the boom when neededthis stand could be fine for you now if you ca n't budget a higher quality stand and it will surely work for some . 
i did give it 3 stars but 2 are for the product and 1 is for the price . 
so i hope all of this helps you with your decision . 
* i 've now purchased and reviewed theon stage 9701band recommend checking it out * this stand is very flexible in the way it can be set up . 
allows you to get close to the mic and still play an instrument , like say a guitar . 
can be used either sitting or standing . 
recommend highly . 
be sure to get a pop screen for your mic and recording needs to improve recording quality . 
this stand surprised my . 
it is lightweight but is still sturdy . 
i would n't venture to use it on the road all the time . 
but as a backup stand i would n't hesitate . 
i like it much better than my musicians gear stand though if this had a double extendable boon it would be perfect . 
i was waiting for a flimsy stand to arrive when i ordered something that seemed like it would be for budget price . 
this stand actually stands . 
i placed my at2020 with a shock mount and a pop filter on , and while it is heavy , with proper tightening everything stayed in place . 
and like many other people say , this is a must-have if you have a home studio . 
this is a pretty good stand for the price , i ended up leaving this one in the rehearsal room as i prefer the telescoping booms . 
i have the dr. pro telescoping and a samson telscoping , the samson is my favorite -lrb- think the model is bt4 -rrb- . 
for the price this is a good value . 
works great and does n't cost an arm and a leg . 
quality is good and holds a microphone with confidence . 
great price too . 
this is a nice microphone stand . 
i have used it on several projects involving sound with no problems . 
i would purchase this again . 
it 's sturdy and gets the job done . 
screws are starting to wear out after about 3 months of use . 
the black covering of the metal is starting to show wear . 
to be expected , but i 'm sure you 'll appreciate hearing that this is not one of those miracle deals where you get something amazing for the money . 
it is what it is , and not much more . 
this seems like a good deal for the price . 
i have concerns about durability for anyone who has to frequently adjust the boom , or takes it on the road , because that boom-adjustment joint is a bit flimsy . 
i bought it for home studio use by just me , so i am totally satisfied . 
this is a fine stand for the price , but i was honestly surprised at how light it is . 
i honestly think on stage might have been making these progressively lighter over the years and now offer a heavier duty one at a higher price . 
i do use this stand , but i wish i would have sprung for the heavier duty version and probably will in the near future . 
it works fine , just keep in mind it is not the heavy duty all metal construction stand of the past . 
this stands up and holds the microphone in place.the stand is study , easily adjustable , and withstands the rigours of use . 
solid , stays where i put it , and does a great job holding a heavy mic , mount and pop filter . 
ca n't really beat it for the price . 
does really good with a fairly heavy microphone , adjustments stay in place without constantly tightening , works exactly as it should good stand , solid components , easily adjustable and the boom is good length . 
i gave it too our drummer and he uses regularly without complaint i actually use this stand for more than holding a mic.i use it for video and photo purposes : holding light reflectors , flagging , speedlights , etc.it 's heavier than it looks and cheaper than those stands specifically marketed for photo . 
this mic stand does everything it says it will , and is adjustable in every conceivable way . 
in fact , the boom has a really nice adjusting lever , making it easy to loosen and tighten . 
the only drawback i found is the tripod configuration of its feet , making it easy to forget where you parked your big feet during live performances ; especially when you 're emotionally invested and the crowd is urging you on . 
i would much prefer a round base . 
other than that , it makes for a great home/garage mic stand when you or your band is just kickin ' it . 
` nuff said . 
i 've written here before that it would be nice to find a multi-pedal arrangement for space saving ... but i still end up looking at individual pedals for their individual sounds . 
musicfriends , this is a fab item - for 20.00 you ca n't go wrong on this . 
warm distortion and good controls . 
for me great studio/recording use but thats it . 
i would certainly not tour with it ... its built cheap w. plastic housing and one circuit board squeezed in and funny enough the one piece rugged metal ... is the bottom plate . 
hello designers ... . 
metal around top and plastic on the bottom if you must . 
but anyways , bottom line great unit for 20.00 and sounds good very versatile . 
a little small for my taste , very thin , but works well and dunlop products have always peased me as a professional musician . 
clear sounding slider works pretty good in the studio . 
i did drop it a couple times -lrb- ok , maybe more than a couple -rrb- on the wood floors of stages without a problem . 
then one day , in the frigidly cold outdoors , i dropped it on a concrete floor and it completely shattered , oops . 
this strap works well , looks good , and is comfortable to wear . 
the choice of colors and durable material are two strengths . 
price was good for a useful accessory . 
nice basic guitar strap . . 
great price and should last long enough . 
i have started using the padded levies strap as it doesnt hurt my shoulder like a regular strap . 
this can be a little scratchy this strap is value for money . 
i was surprised when i got it - i did n't expect something so good at this price ! 
the material is shiny , blue and does n't look cheap and the strap is generously wide . 
the ends are leather with one side having a golden eb logo . 
goes well with my black squier strat . 
highly recommended ! 
they do n't cost a lot and they work well . 
they are inexpensive and they work . 
i have purchased 5 of these for my guitars and they are nice great cord for the money . 
works well with the electric violin and mic my daughter got for christmas . 
will buy more in future very pleasantly surprised buy this one . 
i like the leather ends and it adjust easily and stays put . 
it looks like it will hold up to some abuse as well . 
a nice strap for my lower tier guitars . 
so , you just spent all your money on a guitar and do not want to spend much more accessorizing . 
this strap is perfect , even if you do have the money to spend and just looking for something that will do the job well.the materials are 1 -rrb- high quality soft nylon for the strap - it feels kind of like a non-stretch ace bandage , 2 -rrb- durable non-scratching/marring plastic for the links and adjuster and 3 -rrb- a thick rubber material for the ends.the thickness of rubber material for the end secure the the straps pretty well . 
they do not slide of the strap pegs very easily . 
i say rubber like because they seem more like a synthetic leather but with more flexibility . 
again this material seems to be non-marring . 
all this and a secret compartment for picks.overall , a fantastic product with a price that ca n't be beat . 
highly recommended . 
five stars . 
very good strap , but the pick pocket does not hold the picks securely . 
especially when you take off the guitar for a break . 
either a pocket closure or a spring loaded clip is needed what can i say about a guitar strap . 
it fits the guitar well and is a nice strap for the price . 
i order 2 of these for my electric guitars . 
they are cheap enough and have a pretty good adjustment range . 
the end tabs are either leather or some kind of stiff `` pleather '' knock off . 
they were very difficult to get on my guitar pegs -lrb- not a bad thing as my old strap popped off with the slightest pressure -rrb- . 
these are not coming off anytime soon . 
they are wide enough but do not have any kind of shoulder pad -lrb- i play sitting down so no big deal to me - but if you play standing up these wo n't be the most comfortable straps -rrb- all in all they are a decent strap for the price . 
these straps are very good at a low cost . 
i actually like them better than a few high-priced straps i have and they &#8217; re lightweight as well . 
this strap is very well made . 
the leather is real thick and stiff which make is very unlikely to come off your guitar . 
very happy with this low cost strap . 
i just ordered three different guitar straps online . 
one for my daughter and at first a cheap one for myself . 
then i found this and decided to get it . 
the $ 5 strap worked fine but it was scratchy and stiff . 
i got this and switched over . 
ahhh this is a guitar strap ! 
i see why you pay more . 
it is so soft and comfortable . 
it looks amazing ! 
this is just a great product . 
i would highly recommend it to anyone and am proud to use it on my guitar . 
thanks ! 
this strap is very thick and heavy , which give you a good secure feeling . 
the heavy leather ends are difficult to get the buttons on the guitar through , but your know that they are not going to slip back out.the picture does not do it justice . 
i paired it with my black epi lp and it looks phenomenal . 
i am very impressed with how nice this strap is . 
i installed the ragin ' cajun into my fender super champ x2 . 
i immediately noticed a difference in the quality , fullness and volume of my amp . 
it has turned my amp into a amp that is now capable of being used at small gigs . 
an excellent speaker that i would highly recommed . 
fabulous clean tone , and great distortion sound running off a solid-state amp and pedals . 
the characteristic strat sound of my guitar is very apparent . 
weighs a ton , cool logo , made in usa . 
what more could you ask ? 
i just received these cables today and the packaging they come in is quite simple . 
however , there are two zip ties that secure the cables together so you will need to be careful when cutting them not to damage the cable itself with your knife or scissors.these are , `` value '' cables after all . 
however , they seem very sturdy and are perfect for budget home recording studio use . 
i like how audio technica made something like an xlr cable look so pleasing to the eyes.as for quality , so far i 've been getting a clean signal , even with my cheap pyle pro pdmic58 . 
i had to replace the cable that came with that mic because it was really that awful . 
hopefully the at value cable will hold up ! 
i 'll update this review if anything happens.if your looking for a decent cable for a low price , i would give these a try . 
this cable is very well constructed . 
i use it in my dj business and i highly recommend it to anyone who needs one like it . 
this clip does the same thing that the hercules guitar stands do : lock your guitar in place so you do n't have to worry about it dropping or falling off the hanger . 
the auto-close function on the hanger is the best part of this hanger . 
simply lift your guitar and it lets go everytime . 
i could not expect a better violin stand . 
it is very robust , versatile , good looking and not very expensive . 
highly recommended . 
my problem is that i am used to playing hohner golden melody and special 20 harps . 
i guess i should have paid attention to the other 1 and 2 star ratings . 
these harps have no volume . 
do n't waste your money on them . 
i guess the only thing worth having is the case , but the case has no handles or carry strap .5 / 25/14 - i said the case had no handle , well i take that back . 
there is a little strap inside that prevents the case from opening flat . 
i was able to fold that little strap outwards and then zip the two zippers up to it . 
with one finger i can carry the case with my quality harps inside . 
exceeded my expectations on quality and price . 
when i saw the deal on amazon , i thought it would be low quality harmonicas , but they are good quality . 
im a beginner . 
good harps . 
good solid sound.i cant bend at all so no idea if its just me.youtube these , there 's loads of videos . 
by definition , medium is an in between size . 
but when it comes to guitar strings , most of the range goes from extra light to medium . 
on that scale , these strings would be above a literal medium . 
for me , the guitar is not an everyday instrument . 
i do n't typically spend five hours a day with one , and sometimes go weeks without picking one up . 
but i do have periods where i will spend many hours a day playing and do n't want something that will kill me.medium in the guitar string sense of the word is too much for me . 
light and custom light are easier to play , but can make a higher end martin guitar sound like one closer to the bottom of the line . 
for me , these light-medium are exactly where i want my strings to be.if you like martin 's medium , find them a bit much at times , but find that you give up too much when you play much lighter ones , you may find that these are a great choice . 
i do n't feel i am missing anything compared to the medium . 
if i had two identical guitars with new strings of each type , i would probably find differences in a side by side comparison . 
but without that , i do n't think i 'd notice the difference with normal listening . 
with the lighter varieties , that would be far from true.if martin extra light and light were the skim milk and 1 % milk of strings , these light-medium would be the 2 % that came along for people who wanted something lighter but still came close to the whole milk taste . 
these strings are my second choice after the elixir 80/20 bronze . 
they are warmer sounding , well balanced . 
cost a lot but well worth it to me . 
strings on my accoustic were old , probably corroded . 
it was time to replace all with frest strings . 
these are great , did the job . 
i have had a korg ca-30 tuner for a few years which i really like.i wanted to get a metronome and liked the idea of having a combined unit.initially i bought a boss tu-80 for more money , but returned it because the response time and volume was not as good as the korg tm-40 , and the batteries rattled around in their compartment.also i like having the middle green led for tuning.the price here ca n't be beat and it 's a well built item that works great.i was concerned about the power buttons sticking out too much , but they take more pressure that it would seem , and there is a delay until it turns on or off , so that turned out not to be an issue.i am not real hot for the color , but it 's nicely made and works well , so i will live with it.i especially like the little folding stand in the back , rather than having to find an old credit card . 
got this tuner/metronome as a replacement for a tuner-only model . 
this is incredibly easy to use right out of the package . 
the tuner function indicates clearly whether you are sharp or flat -lrb- or amazingly in tune -rrb- . 
the metronome is easy to use and has great subdivisions -lrb- eighth notes , sixteenths , etc -rrb- . 
for home and ensemble use , i personally could n't ask for a better gadget for the price . 
very happy with it ! 
i am quite pleased with this product . 
it 's relatively inexpensive , small and light weight . 
it operates on two aa batteries -lrb- included -rrb- . 
i use it primarily for a banjo and a guitar and the reference is easy to use and appears to be quite accurate . 
the led and large meter allows these old eyes to see it easily . 
i should have ordered the cm-100 clip-on tuner at the same time -lrb- placed a separate order later -rrb- to allow to tune in a noisy music -lrb- jam or band -rrb- environment . 
you can fine tune your tuning with the calibration settings . 
there is also a 12 note sound generator built in for reference pitches . 
the metronome is pretty loud for the small size . 
i have a hearing loss , so if i can hear it , even while playing , it must be pretty good . 
the speeds are from 40-208 bpm . 
you can select between two modes pendulum step -lrb- preset values , 40,42,44 -- 88,92,96 , etc -rrb- or full step which allows you to change incrementally by one -lrb- 40 , 41 , 42 -- 206 , 207 , 208 , etc -rrb- . 
beat tap allows you change the time signature from 0-7 beats and also duplets , triplets , quadruplets and triplets and quadruplets without center beats . 
it has a 1/8 '' mini earphone jack for private use . 
it is possible to use the metronome and the tuner simultaneously . 
i bought mine from austin bazaar . 
shipping was free and fast . 
i give it five stars and recommend that you can give it serious consideration . 
as an acoustic guitar player , i think this is a great product.i had previously been using the korg ga-1 , which is a fine basic tuner . 
the ga-1 works like many basic guitar tuners , where you designate the string and it shows you the note in standard tuning -lrb- or with one , two , or three flats -rrb- . 
but the tm-40 works by just showing the pitch you 're currently playing among any of the 12 reference pitches - making alternate tunings and open tunings much simpler.now i use the tm-40 at home as my main tuner , and the ga-1 rides around in my case . 
both great products . 
for those of you who are doing jangly pop stuff or real peaky , bitey blues material -lrb- think albert collins -rrb- , this will likely add a little , and i mean a little , extra oomph to your sound . 
it sounds like it uses a touch of reverb and a dash of the higher end of the mids to make cleans sound more sparkling . 
but you should also be able to get the same sounds out of a hughes and kettner statesman 40 or 60 watt amp , too , just running it straight.to me , from what i have heard , it adds nothing to those who use a fair amount of distortion in their music . 
it definitely does n't add any more fatness . 
so my overall impression is that what this box provides is the same thing that some people swear they get out of copper bracelets for their arthritis or feeling better with an increased vitamin e regimen . 
in other words , this is a matter of what is in your head and how suggestable you are.most musicians already use eq and reverb and by careful tweaking of those two things you can obtain what you think you 're getting out of this pedal , i think . 
i 'm not going to do any explaining about the `` science '' behind how this pedal works . 
i 'm just going to focus this review on how the pedal affects your tone . 
this definitely is n't a boost , and it 's also not an eq , the bbe sonic stomp is a uniquely functioning pedal . 
to the ear , it serves to add clarity , depth , and body to your tone . 
essentially , this pedal allows you to get the most out of the tones your amp is already producing.the lo contour knob does n't `` increase '' the amount of bass produced by the amp . 
rather , it tightens up and generally increases the depth of the bass -lrb- and low mid -rrb- tone . 
to the ear this may sound at first like the bass has been increased , but it has n't . 
you 're just hearing all the bass tone that was there in the first place , that was jumbled up as the signal went from your guitar to the amp.the process knob really just focuses on the treble and high mid frequencies . 
these frequencies can often be very unpleasant and grating to hear , and the sonic stomp sort of evens and smooths out those tones so they are clearer and less harsh.that 's not to say that you ca n't dial in some very aggressive and cutting highs if you play lead metal or something ; indeed , it 'll make those searing lead tones even better.now , i gave this product 4 stars not because i 've had any issues with it or have n't been in any way unsatisfied with it ; but rather because it 's really a fairly subtle affect . 
at first i almost could n't tell a difference between having it on and off . 
with time i 've been able to better recognize and appreciate the impact that it has on my tone , but it does n't make a `` night and day '' difference.i recommend this pedal to someone who already has a tone that you 're happy with , and just want to make it even better . 
this pedal wo n't make a cheap 15 watt solid - state combo sound like a tube half-stack . 
it wo n't make you love your tone when you were completely unsatisfied with it before.in conclusion , though i definitely would n't put this pedal into the `` must have '' category , it definitely improves the quality of my tone . 
this is a pedal that i leave on all the time , as it improves both clean and distorted tones . 
brough this for trying `` electric '' feels on the acoustic guitar , and do n't want to waste too much money on electric acoustic -lrb- preamp -rrb- guitar or big amp if i do n't like the `` efeels '' . 
after researching awhile and reading tons of good reveiws of it , i decided to give it a try . 
i did n't expect too much on $ 20 amp , but surprisingly , it positively gives me more than i ask for . 
i also brough it with the adaptor , which is great to save $ $ for long runs , and i do n't have to worry about the battery for home practices . 
it is adorable out of the box ; it looks like a lovely toy , but it works professionally based on its 10w amp . 
i do n't care much about the manufactor 's suggested modes , basically , i just fool around with the three button controls to whatever sounds i like in different songs on guitar / uke . 
i like the small size that wo n't take too much space on my tiny room , it 's cute to look at , and it is practical too!i had the high frequence of feedback as one of the reviwers when i used a poor pickup ; however , when i changed to another one , i can turn the volume as high as i want with the same direction and setup as the previous poor pickup . 
i almost thought that was an issue from the amp , luckily , i have two different pickups to try it deeply . 
after using the better pickup , the amp does n't have any issue yet . 
i have used for few times , so i do n't know about its longevity yet!one more thing about the headphone mode that is not completely silent because the guitar 's sound itself wo n't be muted , but the headphone does mute the effected sounds from the amp ; anyway , it 's a great feature to have . 
it 's not going to win any awards for sound quality , but it sure is cute . 
as you might expect , it 's a pretty boxy sounding little amp , more reminiscent of 60 's portable transistor radios than a double stack marshall . 
but it did the two things i wanted it for . 
first , it has a belt clip , which i can attach to my belt or a guitar strap . 
second , it has a headphone out , so i can plug in a set of ear buds -lrb- 1/8 &#34; stereo jack -rrb- . 
you can get it to a clean decent practice room level if you keep the drive control set at minimum . 
surprisingly , the drive control works it 's way in gradually , letting you control the distortion a bit with the guitar volume control . 
with the drive control cranked up , you can get the amp unexpectedly loud , but terribly distorted . 
for something you can throw in your guitar gig bag and take with you wherever you go , it 's not too bad . 
with a set of earphones , i would put it on par with some of the more expensive amp-jacks that are available . 
if you plan to use it as a practice amp and you 're not moving about , i would recommend getting a power supply -lrb- will use the same ones as most effects pedals -rrb- . 
battery life appears to be around 3 ~ 5 hours , but the performance starts degrading at about an hour 's use . 
i wanted a portable small sized amp for using my electric guitar outdoors -- but was not really in a position to pay the big dollars for one of the high end brands . 
there is of course , very little bass response with this one and it is a tad tinny , but hey , it 's just a 9 volt battery . 
i just wanted the guitar audible for practicing outside and this is a very neat little device . 
they put a lot of thought into this amp , and it is outstanding for the budget price . 
keep in mind , you can patch another 9 volt powered device through this one to enhance it -- i will at some point run my boss digital delay box through it to check that out . 
the belt clip on the back and triple adjustment dials are nice , and i got it in red as a change of pace , because i always get &#34; black &#34; with my equipment . 
it looks very nice and the vintage front design gives it a lot of character . 
nice product , danelectro . 
i cant tell you how impressed i am with this mini amp , i was expecting some little amp with a somewhat of a sound , instead i could n't put it away , i must have played for at least a couple of hours in complete awe , the tones you were able to achieve with just a little knob adjustment was amazing , i would recommend this to anyone that needs a cheap amp , the 9v battery holds up well -lrb- which is surprising considering the drive you got off it -rrb- so spend the $ 20.00 and get something that is a real deal , i hope this helps with your decision about purchasing one i 've tried several &#34; portable amps &#34; . 
for the price , the honeytone ca n't be beat . 
it has volume , tone and overdrive knobs -lrb- the overdrive can go way too over , so easy on that one -rrb- . 
comes with a battery but can be connected to a 9v adapter -lrb- important note : reverse polarity , negative central -rrb- . 
interestingly i have found this amp seems to work significantly better with acoustic-electrics or piezo-based pickups better than magnetic pickups . 
but for a small , portable , light-weight practice amp which one can hook to a belt and attach an earphone ... they do n't come much better . 
it has a belt clip on the back but you 'll have to supply your own earphones and 9v adapter if you want them . 
battery is included . 
of course a guitar cable is a required extra.well worth the money . 
pretty darn good in every way . 
trim and easy to use . 
solid construction . 
i recommend this capo without reservation . 
i like it and it is small . 
this is a fantastic little capo . 
i say little because it is not as big as the spring loaded type , of the shubb capos i 've used.it has a low profile , and i can reach right up to it and still play well.it seems to be sturdy and well constructed , and i love that i can easily adjust how much tension to put on the strings . 
just enough so they do n't buzz and then the strings will stay in tune when the capo is off.much cheaper than the g7th , and does the job just as well in my opinion.for everyone saying that you ca n't fit it on the neck , make sure you get the right capo ! 
if you have a classical guitar , get a classical capo ! 
if you have a guitar with a really thin neck get the lite model capo . 
if you are like most people who have regular size guitar necks , get the normal one.don ' t write bad reviews of the product because you bought the wrong kind . 
love this capo on my electric guitar . 
i can adjust the tension for any position on the neck very easily . 
tried other more expensive capos , but this one is the winner ! 
the only instrument this works well on is my yamaha guitarelele which has nylon strings , for steel strings i want more pressure , i advice getting the ns capo that is not `` lite '' , i prefer that one above this model . 
this is an awesome capo ! 
it 's sleek , light , easy to install -lrb- you can do it with one hand -rrb- and looks nice on the instrument . 
i use the ns capo on my gibson sg special faded and it does exactly what it is supposed to do . 
i love the dial , it 's very easy to use and lets me set it to the just the right amount of pressure where i can still bend the strings but there is no fret buzz . 
awesome product , much better than using a kyser that puts your guitar out of tune and leaves gouges in your neck . 
sounds great on my sg and my acoustic.for those of you wondering yes it does clamp on the headstock if you tighten it down enough . 
i think it also depends on the width of your headstock but it works for me . 
we ordered one , it worked so nicely , we ordered 2 more . 
you can adjust the tension precisely to fit your guitar , and minimize string stress and de-tuning each time you move your capo . 
very nice product . 
this is a very nice product to use . 
i would recommend it to anyone . 
it is small enough to be out of the way while playing . 
it is inexpensive but is difficult to use anywhere with other noise . . 
i used it for several years but it is only a backup now . . 
nice part is that you can calibrate the tuning , although probably would not be used by most musicians . . 
other than that i think money would be better spent on a headstock type tuner . . 
i would not recommend it . 
what can i really say ! 
tunes my entire arsenal.from . 
cigar box guitar , 3 string strummers , tacoma papoose , andmy brand new laguna 6 string . . 
getting ready to make few uke 's and it will tune them also . . 
need a all n one tuner , buy this or an i-phone ? 
the korg is the perfecttuner . . 
the keyboard bench is lower than i anticipated . 
the seat is very soft and comfortable . 
however , it does n't appear to hold anyone with excess weight . 
for me , i can click this in so it is a nearly perfect height . 
the padding is great , it is lightweight without feeling cheep . 
i 'm a heavier fellow -lrb- 5 ' 11 , 220 -rrb- and some of the harder benches i 've tried were a tad uncomfortable for long sessions . 
this one , on the other hand , is very comfortable and has plenty of padding and support . 
it folds up easily and looks to be very well made . 
5 stars , no complaints , and much nicer than a lot of the more expensive options . 
the price is a great selling point , just by itself . 
i use it with my acoustic guitar and the on stage fs7850b guitar foot rest that i bought off amazon as well . 
it 's a good combo . 
it leads me to playing for longer periods . 
it 's solidly constructed . 
it folds and is definitely portable . 
great buy . 
i feel strange giving this classic only 3 stars . 
but it 's just not for me . 
it 's large and takes up space on my pedal board . 
i prefer the little big muff i can not express how over sized this pedal is - it 's ridiculously big and it 's unnecessary.if you are lacking space on your pedal board u may want to look elsewhere or retrofit the insides into a smaller housing as i will do.again - please be aware of the dimensions - this thing is soooooooooooooo hugeit sounds good though - though it does rob tone this is a fine bag for a guitar , i got it for my brother ... i 'm not a music person but its good received item when promised , fits great for my yamaha acoustic electric , but carry with care , remember acoustics are hollow body and can bust if dropped , great zipped pockets . 
i bought a hollowbody without a case and wanted a gig bag in case i decided to take it anywhere . 
the prices of the other bags ranged from more than double this one to almost four times . 
i have other guitars and they all have cases and i might never actually take this guitar anywhere so i didn ' twant to spend a lot . 
price was a big issue . 
the guitar fits great . 
the bag is well padded and i ca n't believe the price . 
i have my 12 string on this stand when i 'm taking a break from practicing -lrb- as you know , a case is where you should store your guitars , not on a stand -rrb- . 
it is easy to assemble . 
you 'll pay a lot more money for stands that do the job just as well as this one . 
if you 're gigging , i might suggest a higher priced stand , but for occasional travel and home use , this will do the trick . 
i bought 3 of these because of the ridiculously low price ... i figured i 'd get my money 's worth from them regardless . 
they work fine . 
so well , that i thought i would buy a few more for the studio . 
the price went up nearly 50 % on them though . 
bah . 
this stand is very nice , it is black and it does its job very well . 
it also has a strap on the top holder to secure the guitar when it is on the stand . 
it is like an added bonus . 
i 've bought quite a few guitar stands off of amazon in the past few years , and i 've paid for the most expensive ones and the cheapest ones , and this is the best one i 've found yet . 
very sturdy , well made , and fully height adjustable , with strong soft foam to protect your precious guitars from getting all scratched up . 
it states that cellulose finishes can be damaged , so at least it lets you know that ahead of time -lrb- most cheap stands do n't -rrb- , so that 's a good thing as well . 
do n't waste more money than you have to for a good quality stand , grab this one ! 
i ordered two of these stands and they work very well ! 
definitely keeps my guitars a lot safer than having them leaning against things . 
case arrived in great condition.quite roomy , fits my vendetta and/or my les paul - two exterior pockets for tools , extras , etc. 2x thicker padding than the epiphone gig bag i got for the lp , but all these have to do is protect and keep dust away - i 'm not hauling them to shows ... get one . 
what can i say ? 
i started out with a couple of pedals , then a wah , then more , then a board for them , and sooner or later all those 6 &#34; cords are either in the way , too short or whatever . 
i do like the male-male offset connectors to bring pedals together but sometimes on a board you 've got odd distances . 
this kit does the trick , and truly was easy to use . 
only once did i create a plug with a bad connection and had to redo it . 
as a newbie violin student i needed a music stand . 
having purchased many things before through amazon.com , i have learned to trust the customer reviews which get posted -lrb- remembering that there will always be a few cranks -rrb- . 
this music stand got good reviews and i can say that i too am very happy with it . 
i would recommend this purchase to any one . 
i was taking lessons from a very qualified instructor and he mentioned that i need a humidifier for my guitar . 
at first i was not sure what i was looking for . 
i found the product without too much difficulty . 
i had learned from my instructor that these are small , placed on the hole of the guitar , and was definitely needed to keep the guitar in good playing condition . 
i started looking through the computer pages and settled on the herco guitar humidifier because of the recommendations of thew product . 
now i feel i made a wise choice and will be able to keep my quitar playing good vibrations , and good music ! 
i used to use the martin tube thing that you stick between the strings . 
but it was a bit of a pain . 
you had to soak it , then drain it , then wipe it . 
even then , i worried about it dripping on the inside of the guitar . 
this is much easier and the guitar sounds great . 
highly recommended . 
these fab pedals are cheap and mostly mediocre , but i bought this on a whim to use with a fender tube amp and it works well . 
as other reviewers have stated , the pedal does not have very good build quality but it seems to hold up okay as long as it 's not abused . 
i use the echo with both a telecaster and a cigar box guitar for vintage effects.i have found that the delay works well around 50 percent and the mix can be modulated to make a good mix of reverb and delay . 
i do n't know if i would gig with this pedal or any othe fab pedal because of my tendency to step hard on a pedal in live environments , but it serves it 's purpose well and is cheaper than alot of other delay and echo pedals if you just need a basic affect . 
i have seen info about modding the pedal to control the delay and may do this in the future.i have alot of other pedals and i tried this pedal with a jazz bass , with some eq tinkering , i found a good mix of echo . 
i originally saw a youtube video of a bass player using a d-4 and thought it would be a good idea . 
again , danelectro makes a higher end echo pedal which probably does a better job with delay , but this is a good deal and was $ 100 dollars cheaper than my electro harmonix memory boy pedal and sounds cool as a vintage vibe with an old amp . 
is the the best pedal ever ? 
not even close . 
does it do exactly what you want a simple slap-back echo/reverb to do ? 
absolutely ! 
i almost always have it on just to add a little depth to my synth or guitar sound . 
it can give you a decently wet surf-ish sound or a fast delay , rockabilly sound . 
it 's not super versatile but if you 're looking for a little depth and color for under $ 20 then this is what you need.i mean , come on ! 
it works , it 's cheap , and it does n't take up much room on your pedal board ! 
i use this all the time for testing audio cables and it works great ! 
it 's got an all metal housing and seems sturdy too . 
battery lasts for months . 
well done behringer ! 
its sound pretty good . . 
i mean , the range / rate arent as broad as others i 've tried . . 
but i stomp on it regularly . . 
it cuts my signal a bit . . 
so i compensate , , an always leave a bit of extra volume in the bank to make it up . . 
all in all = worth it . 
i got the $ 50 standard black on black case . 
the case arrived within 2 days via ups during the middle of the christmas rush ! 
wow ! 
very fast shipping and it was adequately packaged and there was no sign of the box being abused in anyway . 
regarding the item itself , i am bit lukewarm . 
i have a $ 500 washburn and wanted something more than a gig bag for going to and from gigs and practice sessions . 
and i got that . 
its lightweight , plenty of room in the gear box and on top of the guitar head . 
however , the fit is a bit loose and i do n't have the sense that this case will stand up to much abuse over time . 
so if you have a pricey guitar or are planning to load you guitar in a truck with other gear , or might ship your guitar or take it on a plane , this case is not the one you want to buy . 
my seagull entourage rustic fits very snug -lrb- i think that is a good thing , not certain -rrb- in the case which has a nice faux fur lining and seems well made.i was considering theseagull dreadnought casebut there were no useful pictures or details on the item . 
i decided to try the guardian and save a few bucks.seems like i made a good choice . 
great quality , nice interior , and fits my yamaha f335 perfectly . 
solid and steardy case that will last a very long time . 
good quality , strong and excellent finish . 
nicely priced . 
a foot rest will help you maintain a good posture while playing , a must for classical players . 
it 's a great versatile foot rest that any guitar player can benefit from , very good value at only $ 10 not counting shipping , very satisfied . 
i purchased this rack last year to hold my outboard recording gear . 
i liked the fact that it was open in the back so i could patch things in and out easily before i bought a patch bay . 
i find it very sturdy and well made , and i 've loaded it almost completely full . 
i do recommend placing the heavier units towards the bottom . 
simple and useful rack stand . 
easy to assemble . 
easy to mount rack components ... but the rubber leg terminals are easy to lose too . 
a little more interest in the manufacture means more quality . 
for 99 dollars , quit looking at other wah pedals ... this one does it all ... its so versatile ... sounds very authenic 60 's too , ... good pedal movement ... endless variations in sound avaialable ... it gets a great sound right out of the box . . 
dig it man , , !! 
your option to change the wah configuration is amazing . 
only problem is the no dc adapter included , needs buy separately . 
it 's really not a 200w system . 
the booklet even says it is only 100 watts , and i doubt it is really even that powerful . 
the wireless microphone only works when you put your mouth about an inch from it . 
my shure xlr wired microphones do not work with it even with an adapter plug . 
the instrument input works ok with my taylor guitar , but it 's not 100 watts loud . 
i guess it 's ok as a portable guitar amp in a small venue without any vocals . 
this is not a top tier condenser mic , but it is well worth the 40 dollar price tag . 
it has 2 different pattern modes as well as a gain boost switch . 
the carrying case is also nice.do not expect this to be mxl or even behringer b-1 quality , but it 's still better than no condenser , and is perfect for doing room acoustics or live mic ` ing . 
seems to work well . 
like the other reviewers said , you could probably pay 150 more and get the same thing . 
solid construction . 
getting used to the attachment . 
it will never stand in the position like in the photo . 
there 's no resistance on that joint so it flops down . 
just place it upside down . 
record using a headset or you 'll get too much feedback . 
just ordered a shorter stand . 
hope that it works with that joint that makes it stand head down . 
these are condenser mics so you will need phantom power to make them work . 
i 'm using them in our drum room , one is on hi-hat and one is on a small cymbal . 
they have a smooth un-hyped sound.the mics also come with a nice little plastic mounting bar so you can mount them in a stereo pair right out of the box . 
i have used them in an x-y overhead position and they sounded quite good and very natural.some of the other microphones in my kit cost upwards of $ 1200 each so i am aware of what &#34; expensive &#34; microphones sound like , these perform &#34; up there &#34; with the expensive mice while being bargain priced.good music to all . 
it is always a delight nowadays when any electronic device is still functional after such a long time . 
from 2006 when i bought it , till 2013 when i write this , still going strong , very happy with my purchase . 
alas , my experience says newer devices being sold are rarely as good as when they first come out , but you never know , it may still be as good as ever now.for what it 's worth , i am a professional musician with perfect pitch . 
i have had this tuner for about half a year and frankly , i have had enough.the main problem with this tuner is the usability.the tuner has a poor display , is extremely finicky and it does not display the octave of the key.tuning with it can be condensed into one word - frustrating.the needle is very finicky and jumps all over when ever i pick the strings , especially so when the guitar is much out of tune.the poor display is dark , with no build-in light , and has poor visibility at angles too . 
combine all that you have a terrible , accurate tuner.yes , it is accurate but only as accurate as what the graph can display , which is + / -2 cents.enough said , i bought a new tuner , the seiko sat800 , for a bit more money that this.the main differences between sat800 and the ca-40 : sat800 has a build-in light , ca-40 does not.ca-40 has a build-in stand at the back to prop it up to a 45deg angle , sat800 does not.sat800 has a auto and manual mode , ca-40 has auto.sat800 displays the octave of the note , e.g. 1e , 2e , etc , ca-40 displays only displays the alphabet , e for all oactaves.sat800 has a numerical display for the cents off , ca-40 does not.the needle graph on the seiko is much more stable and it is just way more usable overall.i wholly recommend you do not purchase this tuner . 
i was fooled into buying it by the other reviewers on amazon and i hope you would not be . 
used for my guitars also great for adjusting intonation on a guitar ... used on open tunings and bass as well as my mandilin ... ... what happened to all the korg tuners that had led lights on it ? 
do n't get me wrong this tuner works great and makes tuning to e flat much easier than on a non chromatic tuner but that 's all i use it for . 
i prefer my older tuners that light up , this screen is really dim and there 's not a back light . 
my guitar room is n't super bright and it 's very difficult to read.guess that 's why the price is so cheap . 
this tuner works fine for the flute and clarinet however for things that use the input jack it does n't really work . 
as soon as i insert any cord into the jack it automaticly goes to a very low b flat and stays there ... even if the guitar and bass are not on the other end . 
at first i thought it was my cord however after four cords doing this , i also tried other tuners with the same cords and they worked fine . 
so again works good on the sound input but poorly with cord input . 
i 've been very disappointed with this tuner . 
when i 've used it the needle keeps jumping all the way to the right -lrb- sharp -rrb- then back to the left -lrb- flat -rrb- . 
i have two -lrb- 2 -rrb- other tuners i bought from wal-mart and i always get accurate tunings from them . 
i bought this korg because it 's a brand name and the company has an outstanding reputation . 
even though my tow -lrb- 2 -rrb- wal-mart tuners are older , they both still work better than this korg . 
it works beautifully . 
arrived on time as promised as expected it is durable and it is easy and accurate as well , is as described . 
these are the best celluloid shell-colored thin picks around . 
tried all the off brands but came back to fender picks in the end . 
guitar tone is more subjective than almost any other topic . 
and i 'm sure that brand loyalty has as much to do with our perception of that tone as any other ingredient . 
even so , d'addario has provided a consistent product for more years than i 'll readily admit to knowing . 
i 've used may other brands , but i seem to always return to d'addario for all my steel stringed acoustic guitars . 
when they say small , they mean small . 
i had to order the large to get it comfortably on my ring finger , and my hands are not large by anyone 's standards.find the same slide in large , and i wrote a complimentary review there . 
sounds and feels nice . 
i have an entry level guitar , a peavey rockmaster . 
it came with entry level strings . 
these strings make it sound like an upgraded instrument.be advised , the low e string is thick . 
when i try to depress the 12th fret , i ca n't get it to register as a hit with rocksmith 2014 unless i press hard with my middle or index finger . 
well , sometimes the pinky is needed to do that . 
plan on a weaker score if you learn guitar using this game . 
i got these about five months ago and they still have not broken on me . 
that is a record . 
the tones are warm and welcoming , not as sharp as with other strings . 
it is the sound that i like though . 
i use this music stand for my acoustic bass and electric bass these instruments are quite large and it secures the very well and they are very easily accessed . 
i also use it for my acoustic tenor guitar which is on the other end of the scale in size and it works beautifully for it , breaks down to a reasonable size for transport . 
what more can i say ? 
these strings sound great ! 
they play wonderfully , work well together , have a nice brilliant -lrb- but not tinny -rrb- sound , and are excellently made . 
these are not going to unwind on you or break easily.excellent . 
that 's all there is to say about it . 
quality strings at a very affordable price . 
they are made from quality materials and care is given with quality control to ensure the buyer of a good product . 
very good slide smooth sound and reasonably priced i use it with my 12 stringer in open g tuning would buy other products from this company i 've been using dunlap 's tortex picks now for going on 10 years , and recently just switched over to heavy jazz picks -lrb- smaller - sharper tip -rrb- . 
these picks work great . 
they provide enough surface area that they wo n't slip easily from between your fingers . 
they allow for a high level of sensory feedback from your fingertips once you get used to them . 
any jazz or soloist guitar player would likely find these extremely comfortable to use . 
i also prefer the high thickness so there 's no flex in the pick while playing which makes it easy to judge the pressure you 're putting on the strings . 
i just got these in and i have to say , very disappointed . 
it 's as if i went into a boy 's shop and bought a large shirt and expected it to fit a man . 
what do they call medium or small ? 
this `` large pick '' barely goes over my thumbnail area . 
i can hold it , sort of , so we 'll see how well it works with my hybrid plectrum project . 
-lrb- btw , i 'm an average grown man , 5 ' 7 '' , 165 -rrb- more to come ... here we go , a few months later : i just had a chat with a music store guy and found out that a `` large '' thumb pick refers to the thickness of the pick ! 
bottom line , if you want a thumb pick that fits , go to a store and try before you buy ! 
good luck to all . 
i wear a large sized glove , so assuming that would translate , i got these . 
while i can force it over my thumb , it is very tight and uncomfortable -lrb- i.e. , pinches -rrb- . 
my thumbs do n't have a particularly excessive diameter either . 
i 'm gon na try to heat these so i can stretch them a bit . 
i know they need to be snug so the pick does n't rotate when being used , but this is ridiculous . 
three stars because if they fit you , it is a nice pick -lrb- it would be 5 if they were described correctly for sizing -rrb- . 
works as advertised . 
makes the fretboard look and feel nice ! 
i imagine this stuff will last for quite a long time as well since you only really use this when you 're changing your strings . 
this works with equal ease across all six strings , or only the bottom three . 
have n't run across a need to try it on the top three by themselves yet . 
but judging by its performance on the bottom three , and its fierce grip , it 'll do just fine . 
i got it today in the mail , and i already tried it . 
it 's really cheap product but it works really well . 
i 'm really happy with it and it made me save several minutes to change my strings . 
this makes winding strings much faster , but it does feel flimsy , and the end piece does n't fit over my tuing pegs correctly , so it 's a bit of a haslle getting started . 
other than that it 's great for the price , but not a must have and that 's all i 've got to say about it . 
it has n't stuck , broken , or slipped in any of the string-changes i 've used it for . 
costs a little extra , but well worth that price . 
you 'll need a new one about every ten years or so . 
lets face it , in general string winders are pretty much all the same right ? 
wrong ! 
i went with this one because i trusted the dunlop name . 
what a let down . 
on the second guitar i used it on the handle and the head separated , sure you can press it back together , but after separating several times on every string , it gets a little old ... quick . 
already ordered a different one to replace it . 
one thing i cant stand is inferior tools . 
this was recommended by a guitar repair shop , and i have found it is a well rounded product that all guitar players should keep on hand . 
it will polish , and lube things like floyd roses . 
do your strings get funky from the acid in your skin oil ? 
wipe them down with a little dr. duck 's ax wax before you place your guitar back in the case . 
the secret is always use the least you can get away with . 
too much for polishing and you will be rubbing it off forever . 
does it all . 
perfect for cleaning and waxing guitar ; do n't need a bunch of different items ; this does it all . 
these are really cheap strings but how they sound !! 
really good !! 
obviously not for serious live performing but for playing with friends or just rehearse , these are the ones ! 
d'addario strings have never failed me . 
these are so much better than the other nylon strings i used to buy where the ball end always broke . 
these strings sound nice and you ca n't go wrong with the price tag either . 
these are excellent guitar picks . 
they do n't slip in my fingers like the eddie van halen guitar picks i purchased a while back . 
if you have not used tortex picks before , i highly recommend giving them a try . 
they are not flimsy plastic that cracks and splits like most of the tortoise shell picks you see . 
these are much more flexible so they last forever . 
the only reason i 've ever needed to get a new one out of the package is because i lost the one i was using ... just be aware that 0.50 mm is really light for most players . 
they do sell these in many different thickenesses and colors , so give order a few different ones to see what you like . 
my favorite is the 0.70 mm ... it has the perfect balance of flex and strength . 
dunlop 65 cleans the smudges and fingerprints off , but i dont know how well it actually polished . 
i like it well enough , just make sure you have a microfiber cloth to keep from scratching the lacquered surfaces . 
provides a great finish with a nice glossy shine . 
does not leave streaks if used properly . 
this dries quickly every time . 
have used it on a couple of ukuleles . 
on my old dirty beginner uke that had been sitting in a closet unused for years it really made it look like new again . 
i 'm satisfied . 
it really makes your guitar shine ! 
also i use it on my guitar neck and fretboard and keeps it smooth and shiny . 
5 stars . 
also the price is right . 
if there are still people out there who do n't believe in magic , just try this . 
it has truly elevated my playing a few notches . 
i 'd probably have bought another bottle already , but this one seems to be lasting forever ! 
i 've had it a few months now , i use it pretty much a few times everyday , and it still seems full.if after using this your playing does n't improve , then maybe you should give up guitar . 
nice polish/cleaner really works very well on the finishes i have -lrb- cheap glossy chinese electrics , and a matte finish acoustic -rrb- . 
handy to have when your changing strings -lrb- to clean that nasty fretboard - wow do those things get dirty ! -rrb- 
pleasant scent -lrb- lemon oil -rrb- , and no residue . 
lasts a long time -lrb- 2 or 3 squirts will do an entire guitar . 
recently acquired an ovation mandolin , which itself is hardly &#34; standard &#34; in appearance , materials , etc. , so i thought it would bea good opportunity to try a &#34; non-standard &#34; strap . 
i 'm impressed ! 
i 'm thinking of picking up another for a more classical mandolin ... for the price this is a pretty nice strap . 
it 's thin but does the job well . 
the simulated leather end pieces are noticeably &#34; cheap &#34; but its a guitar strap and has not failed me yet :-rrb- for the price this is a wonderful strap . 
it can get twisted and wear out , but keep it straight and it will last you a long time . 
it has a vintage look , very soft and comfortable . 
it also has that vintage fender coolness factor . 
i have 30 + year old leather straps that will be around years after i 'm gone but i paid a lot for them and they 're not as comfortable as this . 
i 've even used these on gibson 's -lrb- oh , the shame -rrb- but of course they look best on fender 's , i guess . 
the truth is they will work on anything . 
the strap ends are great , but they 're not really secure . 
gaskets can take care of that . 
i own quite a few of these are they 're great quality , look cool -lrb- in a vintage kinda way -rrb- and feel soft on my shoulder . 
i chose this for its good looks , but was pleased by its construction as well . 
a very well-made strap with great looks and a super price . 
my only complaint , which is very minor , is that i think the webbing could be thicker and have a more sturdy feel . 
it just feels lighter than i like , but that 's a personal thing . 
i have no complaints about the construction , the looks or the price . 
i use mine on an irish bouzouki , and it really looks great and works great . 
i do n't like straps that have smooth liners that allow the strap to slide around . 
this cloth does n't slide around , and that 's a good thing . 
yes , this pedal is plastic , the switch is not the most durable feeling , and the knob placement is annoying . 
at less than $ 15 , you need to be able to look past these things . 
i 've had a higher failure rate with the dunlop cry baby and that thing is built like a cinder block . 
this pedal actually sounds pretty good when used as intended . 
which is to say , this pedal does a nice job in overdriving the preamp tubes in your valve amplifier . 
no brutalz here unless you already have a good amount of gain going . 
no overdrive pedal lives up to it 's potential running into a solid state -lrb- even modeling -rrb- amplifier . 
it 's just not what they are really intended to do and they end up sounding buzzy . 
some have complained about rf interference with the use of the fab pedals -lrb- getting radio signals through your amp -rrb- . 
i have had that happen with pedals costing 5x the price of the fab - particularly when running a long pedal chain . 
based on tone alone , this pedal can overdrive your tube preamp as well as most anything out there under $ 100 . 
check out the youtube review of this pedal by a guy that goes by ` intheblues ' . 
i believe he uses a drri with a strat , and this pedal sounds great . 
if you did a blind test between this pedal and an overdrive costing north of $ 100 you may be surprised - particularly if your other gear -lrb- amp and guitar -rrb- are halfway decent . 
what i did note though , was that this pedal has a wee bit more gain and a little less treble than my other ts type pedals . 
that does n't make it worse or better - just different . 
the ` mid-hump ' is actually less pronounced than in a tubescreamer , which is a good thing imho . 
there are already enough tubescreamer clones on the market ! 
it will not perform miracles on lousy sounding guitars and amplifiers . 
incidentally , the pedal plays well with other dirt boxes . 
since it is n't true bypass , you will likely get some tone suck if you run a bunch of these in your chain , but if the rest of your pedals have decent bypass you will be fine . 
lest you mistake me for a novice fanboy with no point of reference for my review - i 've been playing guitar since 1979 and have used ` vintage ' dirt boxes since before they were vintage and overpriced . 
i am years past caring about the brand and all about getting good sounds from simple gear . 
ymmv - love that i did n't have to assemble this stand ! 
just had to unfold it . 
was easy to adjust and is very stable . 
it 's nice to be able to sit down at keyboard without having to worry about bumping it . 
also seat fits perfectly under it when not in use . 
i bought a cheep violin to decide if i would like playing it and the pegs kept slipping . 
the peg drops really helped keep it in tune i would n't have been able to do it without the drops . 
got these to stop the pegs from slipping in my cheap new violin . 
added a couple drops , and it worked like a charm . 
a must buy for anyone buying a cheap starter violin . 
it has a tinney sound to it but for 200 dollars or less i would rate this has a top of the line low end guitar . . 
for any beginner this is the guitar i would but in there hands . . 
i still write all my songs on this and play it more then my ! 
000 dollar american strat or 500 dollar ibanez this one is probably closer to a $ 150 guitar . 
the fit and finish is quite nice but at the end of the day it 's just like most of the other made in china guitar . 
from the reviews i was really hoping this was some great gem for only $ 200 , but i 'm not at all impressed . 
one thing that bothered me is that these guys make everything from guitars to jet skis - which usually means they 're a jack of all trades but a master of none.i recently bought a johnson jg-610-n , a johnson jg-620-n , a bristol bd-16 , a jasmine s35 , and this yamaha . 
if i 'd only played the yamaha i 'd probably think it was a pretty nice guitar , but having tried all of these side-by-side i can definitely say it 's not at all amazing . 
the bristol blows this thing out of the water , and not just because it 's $ 50 cheaper , it plays and sounds better . 
the johnson guitars both have a little higher action , not a lot of highs , and a cheaper fit and finish . 
the jasmine is nice but i have n't spent enough time playing it to give a true review.the yamaha fg700gs is definitely neat to look at , and has decent mids , but does n't really have a great high to low end punch . 
now , it it quite a bit wider at the bottom so it has some more body , but , the sound range overall was n't great . 
the bristol has great highs and plenty of deep lows in comparison . 
also , the fretboard felt a wee bit thicker on the yahama , though putting them next to the other guitars it looked about the same.can ' t help but think that the reviews here are a bit `` hive mind '' where everybody buys into a hype . 
maybe i got a dud guitar , but i doubt it , they 're all made in the same factory . 
see my previous evaluation on a similar product . 
it is all a matter of how large you want to chord chart to be . 
unit works fine with my digital piano . 
it 's light , portable and fairly sturdy . 
the price is right for what you get . 
i 've been using this bench regularly since ordering it in 2011 . 
it 's great in all ways but one : the rubber feet constantly fall off . 
if you use this bench regularly , the floor in your playing area will always be littered with rubber feet.solution : usegorilla glue epoxyor a similar superglue to firmly attach the feet to the bench . 
this is what i have done and now i have no problem with wandering feet . 
on stage should consider doing this in the factory to save you the trouble . 
this is a well assembled and packaged unit , designed to a price . 
so certain compromises have been necessary.compromises such as a single-supply wall wart - partly an advantage to get the ac out of the amplifier itself - and very basic circuit , with inexpensive parts . 
the preamp supports only moving magnet cartridges , and has no provision for load adjustments or the like.on the other hand it works well , is packaged nicely , and serves its purpose for folks who are not audiophiles or fussy , but want a basic phono/riaa amp for their turntable to connect to line inputs . 
also , by avoiding the & ldquo ; all-in-one & rdquo ; tendency of units that include inexpensive d/a converters and such for usb output , this is almost certainly cleaner for the analog-only uses for which it is suited.the unit is also very & ldquo ; hackable & rdquo ; if you 'd like to upgrade things like capacitors , resistors , or the opamps . 
or use a nicer external power supply - the first thing i 'd upgrade . 
lastly , if you know the ideal capacitive load for your cartridge , and the capacitance of your phono cables , you can adjust the loading on the inputs accordingly.recommended if your budget is limited . 
boosts the signal without too much noise , though not totally quiet . 
good for lead w / single channel amps ; boosting signal into effects that vary depending on signal strength -- especially at lower practice volumes . 
should be inexpensive ! 
this is a simple preamp booster that adds a bit of dirt so if your looking for a clean boost this is n't it try something else . 
i find this best used to push the front end of a tube amp . 
its really similar to an overdrive accept this boosts more than a normal one and is good for cutting through the mix on a solo or fattening up single coil pickups . 
overall great pedal and amazing price highly recommended . 
ok ... i bought this and after placing it on my pedalboard it was overkill . 
i mean i had enough boost and gain from different pedals already so no use for it at the moment . 
i gave it to a friend of mine that had a simple pedal configuration -lrb- distortion and a flanger -rrb- and it made a huge difference when he needed to make a solo or bring some `` accent '' to a determinate part of a song.it 's a cool pedal but i will recommend it for simple pedal configurations . 
it will bring the extra juice you need.cheers i pretty much just leave these on all the time . 
it gives a good boost and body to my tone , with out being to distorted and dirty , but if you want that type of sound you can get it.great price too . 
-lrb- this review is legit -rrb- i bought this mixer back in august or september , cant really remember , but i had a horrible experience with this unit , but that 's my fault , i bought this mixer without looking at reviews or anything , so i didnt know how to use it.i hooked this up to my desktop through the pink microphone input , and got a horrible , terrible mix , the hiss from the fan ruined it -lrb- i nearly had a panic attack -rrb- , so i took like 9 months to do research , and found out that behringer made the uca202/uca222 for this unit and the 802 mixer , to remove the hiss and unwanted noise.so buy this with the uca202/uca222 to clear up your recordings , do not buy a `` rca to 3.5 mm cable '' if your using this for a studio setting like me , and if your beginning like me , do not let these wealthy people fool you , you dont need thousand dollar equiptment , the podcaststudio usb -lrb- from behringer -rrb- would be fine.so all in all , with my cheap microphone from radio shack and this mixer , the quality was good , but the hiss ruined it !!!!! use a usb audio interface with this from behringer , do it , if you want 5 star audio quality ! 
their website has asio drivers to assist you , ohhh and go on youtube and search up `` uca202 studio '' , you 'll get videos to help.please , please , please , please do research before you buy anything ! 
good day everyone ! 
;d just used mine for the first time today love it it is every thing behringer said it was does every thing i need it to do for my two piece blue grass show i was pleasantly surprised at how well this little mixer performs . 
it was exactly what i needed to record myself singing karaoke on the computer . 
for the price it does a very good job . 
i do n't detect any hum at all and i only get hiss when i crank the volume up too high . 
i recommend this mixer for your home studio . 
it works perfectly with my sound card . 
you do not need usb to get this to work . 
i was looking for a low cost mixer to use with my fostex mr-8 recorder and did a little research on the xenyx 802 . 
just looking at it with it 's inputs , number of controls , i would have guessed it cost close to a couple hundred bucks . 
imagine my surprise when , after reading the positive reviews , that i discovered this thing was only -lsb- ... -rsb- ! 
i bought it immediately and , right out of the box , it did exactly everything i was expecting it to - this is a awesome little piece of gear for getting the recording control and flexibility that is not inherent on the fostex . 
i 'm quite excited about my future recordings using the 802 - i 'm like a kid with a new toy ! 
highly recommended piece of gear that is an extremely great value for the cost . 
this was much smaller than i thought it would be but i kinda like that because it takes up no space . 
it does exactly what is expected of it . 
the effects are pretty good actually and could be used at a push for live or recording work - although certainly would not replace the likes of tc electronics or lexicon . 
relatively transparent and controls are responsive . 
for the money ... good value . 
the mixer arrived early , which was a life-saver . 
i immediately put it to use at a musical venue in which all four microphone pre-amps were used for three vocalists and one flute , and the cd input was connected to a computer that was playing a minus track for the vocalists . 
everything functioned well and the medium reverb affect performed well on all inputs . 
i am looking forward to using more of the effects . 
behringer has had a somewhat spotty reputation among many professional musicians so i was a bit apprehensive about buying this unit but so far , so good . 
the mic preamps sound pretty good - clean and relatively quiet . 
the knobs and slider feel smooth and well made.it also seems to send hotter signal to my jbl eon 510s and that 's a good thing.the built-in effects are probably its weakest point . 
i 've heard some really cheap digital reverbs that are much smoother than this unit.i also wish that the control room knob and outputs were independent of the main output slider . 
that would definitely make it a lot more practical but then again , it would also turn it into a 4 buss mixer . 
so all in all , not too shabby for a $ 110.00 mixer but i probably would n't use it for recording . 
i bought this to upgrade from a eurorack 802 that i had . 
i 'm quite please with the xenyx 1202 . 
lots of inputs , phantom power , and it produces really great sound ! 
i 'm very happy with this little mixer . 
this mixer has four mic inputs . 
it has some fun effects . 
this mixer comes with a 80hz filter and a 3-band equalizer on the mic channels . 
it has a fx-send that can be used as a mono output if you only need mono . 
i do not hear any external noise . 
it has a durable metalic case . 
this mixer has great audio . 
bought this for a modest step up in vocal tracks for home recording on my 24 bit neo 2488 . 
ive been using the mxl990 . 
mic would be great for the price if it wasnt defective . 
used it forabout 30 minutes before crackling and static started . 
had to go back to the 990 until all of thereturn and warranty is taken care of . 
i still recommend the mic though . 
it is hotter than the 990in its highs , but with good compression , power amp and eq the result is well worth the money . 
really a remarkable microphone for around $ 100 . 
very sensitive ... its for studio , not live performances . 
be sure to set your daw insert on your input channel with a compressor/limiter , as you can easily blow through the volume into clipping . 
has a rich warm tone , like tube mics . 
compares to a audio tech 2020 , not in the class of say an audio tech 4040 . 
ca n't beat it for the price . 
i 'm using this pedal like a clean boost for leads , and i 'm very happy with it 's sound . 
uncolored +20 db of clean gain ... i like these picks . 
they look great , and work well . 
i have no issues at all with them , and they play a little stiff when new , but within minutes feel like an old friend . 
great buy for $ 3 . 
give one to a guitar playing friend and watch eyes open wide with a `` no wayyy ! '' 
look on their face !! 
have a couple guitars and a bass hooked in at the same time . 
attaches to my audio interface . 
no cable switching . 
did n't need the sophistication of other mixers costing 5x as much . 
fast convenient way to switch guitars while recording . 
i put two pickups in my resonator guitar , a magnetic and a transducer . 
this is the imd -- improvised musical device -- solution to using both pickups without building a little box with two volume controls . 
i plug two cords into the mixer , one from each pickup , and blend and balance the two pickups . 
it works . 
it cost a a little more than buying the parts to build something like an electric guitar wiring setup but it works out of the box so the labor cost is almost zero . 
bonus , it 's an active device so it can boost the signal . 
only con is that it runs on 12 v and does n't have a battery option . 
i can live with that . 
this pedal , in short , sucks . 
there 's no point to having an a/b pedal if it adds a huge amount of hiss to your sound . 
behringer needs to go back to the drawing board with this . 
i 've had one of these i 've used for years and it has served me well.i needed another so that i could get more headphone mixes out of my soundcard for recording multi-person bands in my home studio.simple to set up : you get an input for your source and 4 outputs for 4 people to listen to the source and each one gets to control their own volume . 
-lsb- ... -rsb- i 've owned and used this for a few years now without failure or flaw . 
the pots all still work without adding noise , and in general the device does exactly what i need it to do . 
you wo n't find a better deal than this on a basic headphone amp/mixer . 
works great . 
for the money you ca n't go wrong with this affect . 
i 'm using it more then i thought i would when i first bought it . 
the only thing i do n't really care for is the stomp switch which is activated with more on a touch then a click . 
seems like it may be a weak point of the pedal but so far it 's held up fine . 
i used this for a while , but now i have the behringer 8ch rack mount and this rarely gets used . 
also , every single bass guitar amplifier that has been on stage when i was the soundman had a balanced direct output right with xlr connector right there on the amp . 
i still use this for practice at home . 
i have an acoustic b100 mkii 100 watt bass amp with a 15 inch speaker . 
my bass is an sx jazz bass . 
i have always loved the tone of my acoustic amp , until now . 
after i plugged this little bad boy in , it brought my amp to life ! 
now , i can not live without it . 
this is the swiss army knife of bass preamps . 
every bass player should have one of these . 
you can dial in tons of different tones and it gives your amp that tube-like sound . 
for 29 bones , you simply can not beat it ! 
spend the extra 10 bucks and get the behringer 9v power supply , so you do n't have to worry about batteries . 
if you are a bass player , just buy it !!! 
i have a line 6 vetta ii with a floorboard that takes care of all my needs for effects -lrb- for gigs and in my studio -rrb- including a wah pedal but sometimes i take my smaller marshall down below to jam with friends . 
i just needed something low-priced that would do the job for me in that situation and i ended up with something a lot more when i bought this pedal . 
i got it yesterday and have been playing with it for hours now . 
i really like it and for the price , i do n't see how you can beat it . 
it seems well-made and i think , or i hope , it will hold up well with normal care . 
i 've only ever used my line 6 floorboard and before that , an old crybaby for wah effects before but i 'll tell you what i really like about this pedal . 
it 's spring-loaded so it comes back up by itself . 
it says you can remove the spring too if you want but that feature combined with the fact that it turns on when you step on it and turns off when you step off of it , allows me to be much more creative in my playing and use of the wah . 
i do n't even have to think about whether it 's on or off which is liberating and it allows me to use the wah in ways i never could before like on half a riff or certain parts of a passage . 
i also like that you can really step on it without worrying about switching it off like other wahs . 
the only reason i did n't give it five stars is because there 's some sort of semi-annoying hiccup in the sound sometimes . 
it only seems to happen in the last part of the sweep when the pedal is coming up , so i can avoid it if i try . 
i do n't know if it 's just mine or is something inherent in this pedal . 
i 'll update this review if i ever figure it out . 
i just got it today and have n't spent too much time with it yet . 
it sounded ok and i like the features on it . 
i especially like not having to step down hard on the toe to engage the pedal . 
as soon as you press down it 's on . 
lots of adjustments so i 'll be tweaking for a while to find my sound , but it seems like it 's going to be ok . 
it 's a lot different from my crybaby so there will be a little learning curve . 
for the money it 's a great pedal . 
i bought the hell babe 10 years ago , it was my first wah pedal and it has been on my pedal board ever since , the same one . 
i have never had a major problem with it , the boost knob fell off a couple years ago but it was plastic and i did kick it a lot over the years so no big deal . 
its no crybaby and im glad , it has its own sound that i have tried to get out of my vintage crybaby but could n't no matter how much i tweaked it . 
i actually run both my crybaby and my hell babe on my pedal board and i find myself using the hell babe way more , especially since it has the auto off and spring back . 
it really makes my solos rip . 
buy it , you will have a ball . 
my only complaint is that the spring is loud and audible when playing acoustic gigs but acoustic guitar sucks so whatever ... . 
it is a good pedal . 
it is not heavy and the price is good . 
it is a good choice for a beginner . 
thank you . 
now i can use the clean channel on my amp , with this pedal , for my acoustic guitar and that leaves my channel 2 for my other pedals and my electric guitar . 
do n't let the system absorbs you ! 
this device as others is really great for the money , check everything by yourself ! 
this is as good as other devices that cost 3-4 times more . 
behringer pedals are really cheaply made and the feel amazingly light , cheap and unable to take the riggors of gigging . 
i just did n't want to spend $ 100 on the boss version , but you get what you pay for ! 
another thing that i hate is it 's really hard to change the battery , unlike the boss pedals . 
save your money and steer clear of this one . 
i also bought a behringer power amp for $ 200 that lasted a few gigs befor it crapped out . 
this pedal works well in my rig , i have two boss eq20 's advanced eq 's and sometimes they are complicated due to the 10 bands they have , this little toy does the trick , and does it very well , i think that people who writes negative reviews do n't know how to use it , it can require some time and experience but having much more expensive equipment to compare this pedal is a very good eq and for the price is unbeatable , highly recommended ... or you can go for the overpriced $ 100 + boss original unit , at the end is the same , maybe a little quieter but essentially the same if you know what you are doing . 
i love this pedal . 
it gives just the right amount of crunch when needed . 
typical behringer pedal with plastic case but a really good sound . 
i use this in my home studio so durability is not a concern . 
nice and quiet when not in use and can scream when you need it to . 
highly recommended . 
this pedal , used in conjunctions with a host of others on my board -lrb- ` the labyrinth ' -rrb- , does what it claims to do and more . 
it seriously boosts the instrument signal from my tele at a mere 50 % level setting and makes the subsequent mxr distortion + pedal crackle with goodness and increased sustain . 
i 've purchased a host of behringer guitar pedals during the last year -lrb- used , i might add -rrb- and am happy with every single one of them . 
do n't let the cheap price fool ya . 
i 've been using all manner of guitar pedals in my work since the 1970 's - yes , i 'm `` old '' - and these stack up against anything similar that more expensive manufacturers have to offer . 
i 'm just glad that i 'm getting most of them for under $ 50 before the world figures out how reliable they are and behringer jacks the price of everything . 
oh yes , i use a onespot 9v multi-adapter to power everything , so i can not comment on how quickly these pedals plow through batteries . 
good stuff ! 
every guitarist needs a volume pedal at some point in a gig . 
the behringer preamplifier/volume booster pedal is an inexpensive yet quality volume pedal that works great ! 
this is an awesome way to get into the in ear monitor game without dropping hundreds of dollars . 
adjust your volume of the main mix , and adjust your instrument/mic level relative to the mix without affecting the main sound or your band mates feeds . 
perfect for that singer or musician who is constantly asking for &#34; more me &#34; in their monitor . 
you can also use this to control a floor monitor if you want . 
this is definitely a must have for the home recording enthusiast , especially if you are using any of the xenyx or other behringer brand mixers -lrb- it also works with other mixers as well -rrb- . 
this is a great , inexpensive , way to get your analog audio into your digital recording software . 
it works on windows , mac and linux -lrb- at least it did for me -rrb- . 
this unit works great for taking a line level from something like an audio mixer or even an old cassette deck and converting it into a usb audio input . 
i have not used the headphone monitoring section -lrb- doubt i ever would -rrb- so i can not comment on that feature , but this unit is so simple to use that i was pleasantly surprised.for anyone in a band out there - i used this device to take a line out from our pa system into an old laptop running -lrb- free -rrb- audacity software and was blown away by the quality of the recording . 
this even helped us to figure out better vocal balance technique for some parts that were not quite perfect on stage . 
the software itself -lrb- sound/interface -rrb- : 4.5 starsthe installation and activation : 2 starspros :1 -rrb- the drums included in ez drummer are the most realistic `` computer drums '' i have ever heard . 
i 'm using them on my latest song and have gotten nothing but compliments on how they sound .2 -rrb- all sounds are midi , which means you can manipulate how you see fit . 
i use ez drummer with mixcraft and have modified pretty much every beat i have used so far with the built-in midi editing capabilities .3 -rrb- the interface is clean an easy to use . 
you just drag a beat from the ez drummer window into your daw.cons : when i was reading reviews i just thought the people complaining about the install/activation were being wusses . 
i mean seriously , how hard can it be ? 
well , they were right , it sucks . 
it took me two hours to get it all working.my advise : do n't even install the app from the included disc . 
instead , just go create yourself an account at toontrack.com and download the most up-to-date version and all the patches for the modules that come with it.my experience :1 -rrb- try to install from disc . 
fails with a 1308.2 -rrb- google 'd the problem . 
found out i needed to get a toontrack.com account and download the installer from there .3 -rrb- downloaded the ~ 650 mb zipped installer . 
then , i had to unzip the 18,000 files , which took about 20 minutes on my pc .4 -rrb- i was finally able to install it and then had to download three other updates to the modules within the install .5 -rrb- then i had to jump through one final hoop to active it -lrb- take this key copy it here , then copy this here , stand on your head , etc. . -rrb- . 
great software , horrible install . 
~ slick a breeze to install on my mac mini , simple to use with garageband . 
the bad reviews here are bizarre , written by inept people who either ca n't handle the install or have a buggy pc or os . 
i was up and running 5 minutes after i tore off the shrink wrap from the packaging.there 's plenty of specs/details/videos on the interwebs about this software , go do some research , see if you like it . 
it 's way better than the drum kits that come with garageband and there 's plenty of kits to expand with . 
i got the vintage rock kit and i love it - almost as much as i love pizza , which i will marry some day . 
i like a cheese pizza . 
some call it `` plain '' but with the right blend of sauce , cheese and crust , there 's nothing plain about it - it 's somewhat complex , much like myself . 
we are a perfect match , pizza and me . 
we go together like shoo bop shoo wadda wadda yipitty boom de boom . 
i 'm not exclusively a thin crust guy , sometimes i dig something a bit thick or an all out deep dish.the only weak point in this pizza i mean software is that you ca n't do a cymbal swell . 
apparently , it 's the same with all these virtual kits , regardless of brand , but it would be nice if someone -lrb- toontrack -rrb- would address it by including a `` side stick '' attack on the crashes . 
if you try to do a cymbal swell , you hear the initial stick-on-cymbal `` ting '' with each attack , so it 's kind of a `` ting-ting-ting-ting '' sound instead of `` bwooooosssshhhhh . '' 
i 'm sure i can find a bwoosh loop without a ting-ting . 
bwoosh loop - no ting-ting . 
do i get a fortune cookie with that?pizza time!ohhh , myyyy loooove ... my darlin ' ... i hun-ger for ... . 
your crust ... . 
for anyone who has had the experience of a strap coming off at the most inopportune time and seeing your baby go crashing to the floor only once , is enough to justify a strap lock system of some kind . 
i mount my guitars on the wall when they are not being used , so i wanted a strap that can be put on and taken off easily . 
anyone who removes and reinstalls their strap knows that it does not take long for those eye holes to become loose . 
also , i did n't want to have short &#34; strapletts &#34; dangling from my guitars while it 's being displayed . 
so for the couple bucks they cost and 10 minutes , i get everything i wanted . 
quick release and reattach of the strap , the piece of mind that it 's not going to just randomly drop one day , and they come in all the standard finishes , chrome , black , gold , nickle and they do not detract from the visual artistry of the guitar while on display . 
i have these on all my guitars and always will . 
as an added bonus , once you have these on multiple guitars , you can quickly swap out straps as often as you change your underwear . 
there is n't much i can add to the good reviews already out there that i read before purchasing these for my 91 american tele but i will say i really like these tuners and i 'm very happy i switched to them . 
high quality and great design . 
the guitar just stays in tune now , period . 
attractive too with the fender f on the face of the locking knobs and not a big bulky look like i thought they may be before i tried them . 
very easily installed without any modification to the headstock of the guitar . 
if your thinking you might like to upgrade to locking tuners but having doubts whether you 'll like them or if you should go with a different brand ? 
go with it and get a set of these ! 
if your experience is like mine you 'll be very satisfied . 
these locking tuners are perfect for any strat or tele . 
i have an american strat and an american tele that both came with fairly decent non-locking tuners . 
i also have a carvin and two paul reed smith guitars that came with locking tuners ... they are certainly worth having . 
fenders -lrb- at least american-made ones -rrb- are very easy to swap out tuners for these ... the holes are already there , there 's no need to drill holes for screws , everything is so easy you have to do it yourself . 
i 've swapped out the tuners and have never looked back ... the only question is what to do with the non-locking fender tuners i have now ! 
i put these on a dual humbucker usa strat . 
the neck was pre-drilled so the posts on the tuners and the diameter of the center post fit perfectly . 
job only took about 15 minutes . 
excellent build and looks great . 
these really are n't a very good value . 
if i had to do it over again , i would probably get wilkinson locking tuners which are much less expensive and a lot easier to install . 
if money is no object and you need the f trademark on your tuners , then i guess these are for you . 
i did the swap myself in a couple of minutes , this are the ping model 18:1 ratio and they stay in tune just perfect ! 
perfect retrofit for my 1989 american strat . 
the locking mechanism is strong . 
no problems at all . 
i like to stay brand loyal , so i honestly think these tuners will go on the rest of my fender collection . 
tuning is a breeze and is very stable . 
nearly all of the reviews i read on these were very positive , and i concur . 
these are very nice , solid tuners , especially for the price.they do add a little noticable weight to the headstock , but it 's not a problem . 
these replace the oem tuners exactly without requiring any modification of the headstock . 
they look fine . 
when i get the guitar back together i expect that they will work properly . 
delivered on time as promised quality tuners overall . 
i like the look and feel of these . 
the only complaint i have is that after &#34; locking &#34; the strings the tuners loosen slightly a short while later . 
so i have to continually check that they are indeed still locked.all in all though very good for the price . 
i have a squire tele and replaced the tuners with these . 
the ` tab ' holes did n't match up , they are bigger than the squire originals but it was no problem to set new holes and tighten them up . 
the hold tunings and make string changing a breeze . 
highly recommended . 
true fender product . 
they do the job of lighting your music up and they are easy to clip onto your music stand . 
the switches on the lamps however are a bit flakey . 
not very bright . 
not very flexible . 
too big . 
clunky . 
i really do n't like it . 
i wish i had went in a different direction . 
this amp sounds great , looks great , works great and is a breath of fresh air from &#34; modelling &#34; amps or ones with many effects that require regular use of a manual to cycle through . 
this behringer has a dial offering four effects styles with five &#34; flavor &#34; settings in each . 
they are all on one dial and there is no pushing , pullling or holding for seconds for lights to tell you you 've switched gears . 
here you just turn the dial one little click at a time to find a sound out of the twenty . 
there is a simple level knob for the intensity of the affect and the great thing is that a foot switch is included where you just stomp on a button to invoke your effects or return to clean acoustic guitar . 
the foot switch has a second button for the other channel which can accommodate another guitar , microphone for singing , drum machine . 
the eq sliders are quality and give you a nice reference from a distance whereas if the were knobs you 'd have to be right up on them to see how they are set . 
i 've had no problem with the front cover as a few others have mentioned -- it 's velcroed on there just fine . 
the cabinet is covered in a nice brown leather-like material . 
plenty loud . 
i bought the mini tone master as a practice amp for my dean evo electric guitar , and love it -- but there are a few things you should know before a possible purchase :1 . 
when they say `` mini , '' they mean it . 
it 's a tiny little thing about the size of a hardcover book -lrb- or smaller -rrb- , and about as thick -lrb- 2 '' thick or so -rrb- .2 . 
it also runs off a 9v battery , though if you have a dc9v adapter , there 's a plug for it . 
it also has a 1/4 jack for standard headphones or earbuds as well .3 . 
it 's loud . 
even when at low volume its tones will fill a room . 
this is a major plus for such a tiny , inexpensive amp.controls on the amp are great ; it has a gain/distortion knob that is almost as good as having an overdrive or gain effects pedal hooked up to a full-size amp . 
it 's strong enough to where if you 're playing small gigs such as coffeehouses or hole-in-the wall small bars , you wo n't need to lug along your 10w -lrb- or larger -rrb- amp with you , though that may depend on the tone your guitar puts out to begin with . 
still , this is an awesome deal ; i paid about $ 30 here on amazon for it , so if you need a practice amp but do n't want to spend a ton of cash , snatch up one of these little bad boys . 
you wo n't be sorry . 
overall dimensions 6 3/4 '' x 6 1/2 '' x 2 1/4 '' . 
very nice travel size . 
sound is about what you would expect . 
it is basically a toy . 
if you use more than 2 -lrb- of 10 max -rrb- gain , it sounds awful . 
i turn guitar volume to max and adjust volume on the amp to desired level . 
tone works nicely to filter the output over all frequencies . 
i am using it with a fender starcaster when i travel for work -lrb- hotel friendly -rrb- . 
i think it 's over priced but i think it looks good and it seems durable . 
so , these ended up being the wrong taper for my guitar , but that was my own fault due to some incorrect advise . 
nonetheless , i put a couple in just to compare them to my old , plastic pins . 
what a difference ! 
unquestionably , the sound board was far more sensitive . 
sustain was much better and i got a richer tone , as opposed to the brighter tone some users reported . 
i should say , however , what i got was definitely the true , ebony wood pins with the inlay . 
i ca n't speak to concerns about plastic being used for the other pin colors . 
while these wo n't work due to size , i 'll definitely be making the switch from plastic to ebony when i find the right size . 
the samson shock mount does work with the audio technica at2020 , yes . 
does it work well ? 
if you can securely close the little gap between the at2020 and the shock mount then , yes . 
there is another reviewer on here who gives a very good tip on getting rid of that rattle when using this mount with the at2020 . 
only other thing is that the colors do n't really match up well but i do n't really care , its a good shock mount.ask yourself before you buy though , do i really need one ? 
i do n't really use mine since i have carpet on the floors that does n't like the mic stand shake too much . 
i picked this up for a friend who has the audiotechnica at2020 usb and yes this does work with that mic too . 
it 's solid , helps with mounting , and will be well used . 
this is a quality product.super fast shiiping through amazon as always.the product is well built easy to use pretty straightforward.it 's perfect for my samson mic . 
i picked one of these up when they were being blown out cheaply at a big box store . 
who does n't need another pocket tuner to throw in the guitar bag , right ? 
the price was less than ten bucks , but unfortunately it does n't work very well . 
the microphone inside the unit is simply not very accurate . 
it gets you in the ballpark , but just barely . 
strike a note once , and it 's sharp . 
play the same note with the same force again and it says you are in tune . 
i think the korg tuner is in roughly the same price range and it performs the job much better . 
very compact size and easy to use.good feature for the price.shipping is fast.very happy for this product.best recommended . 
it works great , not much i can say beyond that . 
to be honest i 'm not metal guitarist but i do love metal music and as far as playing goes i love bluesy solos with lots of distortion . 
i decided to get this pedal because it was electro harmonix , one of the best names in the business . 
and for the fact it was cheaper than most . 
i 'm very pleased with the pedal and could n't be happier . 
since , as of right now , this is the only review of this product on amazon.com , i 'll try to answer any questions you might have about the ehx pocket metal muff pedal . 
this pedal is the model of simplicity ; a volume control , a distortion control , and a switch that changes the amount -lrb- or lack thereof -rrb- of mid-scoop . 
that 's does n't leave much room for tone tweaking , so `` tweakers '' beware ! 
that being said , electro-harmonix did a commendable job of pre-setting useable treble and bass tone levels that should only require minor tweaking of your amp 's eq to get it right where you want it . 
playing through my fender hotrod deville amp , i was immediately shocked at how good this pedal sounded . 
the bass was powerful and chunky , great for heavy metal palm-muting riffs ; the treble had a good bite but it was n't harsh ; and all three midrange modes sounded great , depending on the application : want just a flat midrange for a punchy tone ? 
just leave the mid-switch on the flat setting . 
want a slightly scooped midrange tone for a good all-round metal tone ? 
move the switch down to the low mid-scoop mode . 
do you want to play master of puppets by metallica ? 
the high mid-scoop mode is calling your name . 
this pedal offers quite a bit of distortion , but i was amazed to find that even at the higher distortion levels , my tone remained clear and defined . 
it did n't turn into a plastic-y , fuzzy mess like most distortion pedals * cough * metal zone * cough * will . 
i will mention that this pedal is n't the best if you 're looking for a more modern metal tone . 
you wo n't get a slightly fizzy , ultra-gain -lrb- think slipknot -rrb- sound out of this pedal . 
rather it offers a very crunchy , defined roar more characteristic of the pre-dual rectifier mesa boogie amplifiers.in conclusion , i give this pedal 5 stars because it does what its designed to do very well ; this version of the metal muff line is n't designed to be highly versatile and `` tweakable '' in and of itself ; get the metal muff with top boost pedal if you want a 3-band eq and a boost function . 
this pedal is designed to be a very simple , small box of pure classic metal tone , and that 's exactly what it accomplishes . 
within just three seconds of using the electro-harmonix pocket metal muff pedal , i knew it was a winner . 
it delivers thermonuclear distortion and is ultra-easy to use . 
although it does n't have a tone dial , it does n't need one . 
and i say that after trying it through a small tube amp -lrb- 15w -rrb- , a small digital amp -lrb- 40w -rrb- , a guitar with humbuckers , and a guitar with single-coil pickups . 
the closest it has to a tone dial is the scoop switch just above the on/off switch . 
as its name suggests , this allows one to choose how much the mid tones will be `` scooped . '' 
it has three settings -lrb- no scoop to maximal scoop -rrb- , and all sound great . 
fans of sustain will love this box , for it delivers seemingly everlasting sustain . 
the pedal is extremely small , which most would regard as a plus . 
i bought this after watching a professional-looking youtube demonstration of it . 
it more than lived up to my expectations . 
if i lost this box , i 'd immediately order another one . 
i have zero regrets . 
this is an amazing acoustic amp for my classical guitar . 
i use this to play in the church and a friend of mine approached me and said that the sound is really crisp and bold . 
i was happy . 
just an all around nice case , good construction , good zipper and padded enough without causing it to become hard to maneuver . 
this is n't one of those semi walled cases , this is just a normal gig bag . 
works for me , in fact i bought another for my classical . 
the e-bow is a great tool for any musician looking to get a really neatethereal sound out of their guitar . 
great tool ! 
got the mics from dealer fast . 
i pluged them in and they are great no feedback and great sound . 
they sound better than my sure mics looking forward to useing them at my next showi would tell a friend if they want set of good mics at a great price these would be the ones do you have a hercules guitar stand ? 
then this will make transporting it easy . 
it seems like a gimmick , but i have two stands and it 's nice to be able to grab both of them by using the bag straps , and still be able to carry more gear with my other hand . 
i 'm used to conventional steel finger picks . 
these actually work really well as long as you do n't play hard , like i sometimes do with my other picks . 
playing hard really hurts my exposed finger pads that are ordinarily covered by regular picks . 
however , these allow for better touch and expression when playing softly . 
these microphones have a quality-feel to them and they all worked perfectly . 
i used them with my harbinger ha60 pa system and i was not disappointed . 
they do n't come with cables so be sure you have some available -lrb- xlr-xlr -rrb- . 
you can get a 25 ' cable for under $ 5 also here on amazon . 
good deal all around . 
would not hesitate to purchase more of them if i need to . 
these mics are great . 
i was n't sure what they would be like but i would buy them all again . 
they are cheap enough to replace and they sound great . 
we shure mics and they needed repaired all the time . 
these have a bigger sound pick up area and they have not had any problems at all . 
i got this yesterday , and everything was alright , accept that two of the three mics worked . 
one was dead . 
i tested all three of them with the same , and different cable , and made sure that the the on/off switch was on . 
it was first mic i tested of the three , and the dead one of the three . 
everything was good accept for that one microphone . 
these are pretty standard dynamic mics , and for what you pay the quality is good . 
i use them as room mics mainly , for which they perform admirably . 
i 've only used them once for -lrb- backup -rrb- vocals , and the results were good . 
would recommend these for folks on a budget . 
also , the case is nice . 
these do n't sound all that great on stage or at rehearsal with the my other sm58s and beta 58s in a band situation , but that actually was n't the purpose of these microphones ... the real purpose was speech through a ceiling speaker system , at which they excel . 
the facility we use these at , the mics have a habit of walking away , or escaping maybe ... stolen ? 
perhaps . 
they sound great through the ceiling , they have on/off switches , and they 're cheap , we can just buy another box of 3 in a few months when we 're down to 1 again . 
seems like they 'll last forever , too bad they keep wandering off on us . 
podcasting on a bit of a budget -lrb- $ 200 setup -rrb- , i wanted good sound quality , nice warm tones ... . 
these mics deliver in a world where i did n't quite have the cash for condensers i wanted . 
i needed four mics and this was the best cheap option and my word , these sound great . 
3 for under $ 40 was fantastic . 
i am glad i did n't break budget here . 
i 'm using these with the behringer 1202fx mixer . 
i am so extremely happy with them . 
my band had no pa or mics or anything . 
while i admit these are not the quality a band will work up to , they fill up the stands at an affordable price . 
not much distance -- you have to &#34; eat &#34; the mics -- but the sound is great . 
full range , clear -lrb- not muddy -rrb- , and no breaking up of sound . 
this is a great place to begin . 
i have four of these - and will continue to use this product . 
you 'll purchase this system first , then all you need to do is get the replacement packs . 
for my taylor baby , the string spacing was a little small , but there was no problem inserting the pack in my other three guitars . 
very easy to use . 
as a recommendation for keeping your guitar in good condition , i would also buy a humidity meter so you can keep tabs on the room where you store your instruments . 
i bought this for my taylor 714 . 
it seems to keep things humidified very well . 
i like the idea that it takes moisture out and puts moisture in as needed.i have replaced packs twice . 
i have not had any problems with the packages leaking or creating any problems in the guitars . 
these work great keep the guitar case around 43 degrees but do not seem to last as long as they did in the past . 
they are easy to use ... . 
i continue to buy them because i live in a dry region of the country . 
i recently picked up asquier fretlessbass . 
as with any guitar , the factory strings left much to be desired . 
with fretted basses , i 'd always liked strings with a little brassiness . 
but round-wounds just did n't feel -lrb- or sound -rrb- right on a fretless . 
small vibrato was hard to achieve with the string friction . 
and round-wounds just did n't have that acoustic sound . 
there were quite a few choices for fretless strings , but i 've always liked d'addarios on my 6-string guitars . 
these flat-wounds were a perfect choice . 
they 've got plenty of bottom , but the midrange is more pronounced than other strings . 
the bass sounds more like a ` real ' bass . 
and the action is now so smooth . 
i can use a small vibrato when i like -- no longer restricted to the wide jaco-style . 
there are all sorts of bassists who look for all different sorts of sounds . 
but there 's something about a fretless that attracts a particular sort of player -- the player who wants a bit of that upright bass sound . 
as soon as i put these on , i felt like i was home . 
in my 13 years of playing the guitar i have settled on d &#8217; addario as my string of choice . 
when i picked up the mandolin four months ago deciding which string to buy was easy . 
i &#8217; m really glad i did . 
the tone is great , they &#8217; re durable and smooth on the fingers . 
even though they are smaller strings they still produce the sustain and bell-like tone that mandolinists are after . 
they respond great to different styles and dynamic levels . 
you can play sweet classical passages , roaring bluegrass and even rock . 
i have a high end washburn f-style and these strings coupled with wegan picks make the washburn sound spectacular ! 
they also bring out the sound of the wood too which i appreciate . 
if you are in need of a smaller string that still sounds good , this is the pack to get . 
thanks d &#8217; addario for providing an awesome product ! 
i like these strings for their warm & mellow tone . 
they are easy on the fingers , and i prefer the silver-wound basses . 
summaryacoustic sounds &#34; ok &#34; , but noisy in weird ways . 
i returned it . 
price seems high for what it is and vs. alternatives in the marketplace.pros - boss case is metal , mechanical design is durable - standard 9v power , and the power jack is on the back where it belongs . 
- variety of acoustic sounds possible . 
-lrb- personally , i only thought 1 of them sounded realistic at all though -rrb- cons - fizzy noise integrated with notes played -lrb- or chords -rrb- - generally kind of noisy in the pedal chain - while i have several boss pedals , i think they always make the knobs too small and the font/print too small . 
i prefer pedals with larger and fewer knobs that can be tweaked with your toe if needed while playing.details : the basic concept is good . 
i had an ac-2 -lrb- prior model -rrb- and sold it because it had a noise problem where there was a fizzy noise when you play a note . 
it was n't in between the notes or when not playing , it was integrated with the sound of every note you played -lrb- or chord -rrb- and you could not filter it . 
it was also just noisy in the pedal chain . 
adjusting your guitar volume down for higher gain pickups helps some . 
however , i sold that model because i did n't want the pedal in the chain with everything else and i was n't happy with the sound . 
at the time , the ac-2 's were selling for about $ 85 new . 
boss since redesigned and raised the price significantly on the ac-3 . 
i bought the ac-3 hoping they had improved the issues of the ac-2 -- and they did , a little . 
but not enough to keep it . 
i returned it after a week because it still has the same basic issues , just not as pronounced . 
i think the ac-3 could work for gigging , but there are other choices that sound as good for $ 25 instead of $ 130 to $ 150 -lrb- with tax and/or shipping -rrb- so to me , the boss pedal is overpriced and not that great.i opted for a behringer acoustic modeller instead . 
they make two -- a &#34; 300 &#34; and a &#34; 400 &#34; . 
the 400 has reverb on the pedal . 
i opted for the 300 and got it for $ 25 . 
i expect the durability will be lower on the behringer than the boss as it has a plastic case . 
however , this is an affect i pull out just once in a while and since i can buy 4 or 5 or 6 behringers for the price of a boss ... if it breaks ... i 'll just buy another.i also have a boss gt-100 multi-effects unit . 
you can get the same or similar acoustic modelling sounds out of that , out of the behringer or out of the boss ac-3 . 
the least cost effective of those choices is the ac-3 - and it has noise issues the other two do n't have.i 'm not saying its a bad pedal , i 'm just saying it was n't the best choice for me when considering the cost , the sounds , and my usage model . 
if they would fix the noise issues , i might have even kept it . 
i did opt to keep the behringer for those times i 'm using a discrete pedal board and want an acoustic model affect . 
this boss pedal just did n't work that well for me . 
works well . 
very well constructed . 
would it kill ya to add an on/off switch so that the batteries do n't run down ? 
other than that , it 's perfect ! 
nice picks . 
a bit small for my preference . 
great for picking , kind of harsh for strumming , quality seems top-notch . 
some guitarists will love these . 
a very nice pick , both in feel and texture -lrb- the design is a bit boring , though -rrb- . 
only complaint is that it 's fairly small - about the size of a canadian or us five cent piece , where most of your typical guitar pick are bigger - about the size of a 25 cent piece . 
but that 's okay . 
i got this the same time as i got a set of dava jazz grip 9024 red picks and the dunlop max grip jazz iii carbon fiber guitar picks , and i think i like the dava picks the best . 
all three are &#34; tight grip &#34; picks , and all the same size - they 're all good , though - i 'd rate this one next-best , and the jazz iii carbon fiber next after that -rrb- . 
replaced the plastic saddle in my yamaha f335bl . 
had to file it to make it thinner , and filed it down to make it shorter than the old saddle , this made the action a bit lower and made it easier to play for a beginner . 
it did change the sound of the guitar , it sounds fuller , and the sustain is longer . 
the compensation built into this saddle makes another hit with graphtech tusq products for me . 
they have done the hard work , just needed some personal fine adjustments and good to go . 
good sound quality for not being bone . 
i have a tired 16 year old lefty acoustic guitar that needed some love . 
i decided to replace the saddle with this one . . 
and it required some dremeling/sanding to get it to sit correctly . 
it was easy to do - and now my guitar has no buzzing on any of the frets and it sounds great with new strings . 
it also brightened up the saddle/bridge because my old saddle was turning yellow and not too nice looking . 
this one is an ivory-ish color and it is really nice . 
disapointed . 
the sensors are not providing a clear full bright sound . 
it sound muffled . 
i will have to replace it soon . 
sturdy , strong , good quality cable for guitar , especially like the fit with the right angle plug . 
would purchase again if need bd wish i would have bought 4 of the 20 footersgoing to buy more of them for sure they are great guitar cables if you need a well made cable in a short length , i would n't hesitate to recommend these . 
buy one now . 
cheaper and as good as if they were original gibson , fit well and look well , tune well everything , get them ! 
i 've tried pretty much every harp out there , after having played the regional blues & jazz circuit for about 10 years . 
lee oskar harps are the best value.on top of it , lee oskar actually called me once just because i left a question on his website!i 've met rick epping -lrb- of hohner harmonicas -rrb- at namm - great guy - but he never called me at 3:30 in the afternoon just because i could not identify a song i thought he was playing on!i carry around between 10 or 12 harps to a gig , so that is at least $ 290 for a set of lee oksar harps .10 suzuki manji harps , while nice and the phosphor bronze reeds are great , would cost nearly $ 480 - presuming you could find them.i will not say i 've never blown a reed on a lo , but i will say that $ 22 for a new set of lo reed plates beats $ 48 for a new manji , at least in my book.on top of it , all they really did with the manji is discontinue the `` bushman delta frost '' harmonicas and rename them so they could double the price.lee oskar harmonicas are inexpensive , they are simple and cheap to repair , easy to play , have great tone , and are even easy to identify since the 1st & 2nd position keys are printed right on the comb . 
that feature is great for beginners who might not be able to keep them straight yet.give them a shot . 
my son had his eye on a vintage harmonica that my great uncle used in europe during ww i. needless to say , i did not want to pass this on to him yet . 
i figured he could start simpler . 
i read the reviews of the harmonicas and saw nothing but positive about this instrument . 
it has a great tone . 
its construction is solid . 
i am sure this will give him years of entertainment . 
this is not a toy - a great addition to your mouth harp collection . 
sadly , i ca n't review the mic itself nor the cable that comes with the mic as they were both non-responsive . 
i tried the mic with other cables i have lying around that i know work , and i got nothing ; it was like the mic was n't plugged in at all . 
and the cable included in this pack , well , the plastic -lrb- not metal -rrb- connector to the mic was cracked . 
i still tried it with a difference mic ... static.i ca n't blame amazon for the broken bits as the whole thing was packed well and the box did not appear damaged.the stand that comes with this set up seems really good for the price of the whole package . 
i was impressed at how much of is * is n't * plastic.still ... i ca n't recommend this product . 
having 250 feet of xlr - xlr -lrb- m-f -rrb- cables that can be used any way i want -lrb- e.g. 2 ea 125 foot for stereo , 1 250 foot for mono , or 10 ea 25 foot for multichannel work -rrb- is very flexible.the packaging on these was also well done with a ziploc type bag and a velcro reusable wrap on each cord -lrb- white -rrb- to store them when not in use.as all of my sound equip is xlr or speakon connectors , this worked great for a recent outdoor dj job . 
i ended up using all 10 of the 25 ' cords for mics and amplified speakers , plus another 6 of their 3 foot cables for interconnect . 
you can never have enough xlr cables or adapters ! 
for me the combination of color coding and high quality cables make this a great value.it 's the cable construction that drew me to these in the first place . 
the insulators are tough and do not easily nick when being dragged around on rough stages . 
however , it 's the attention to small construction details that i love . 
the xlr ends are quality components , but cheap , ill fitting junk that some companies use to keep costs down . 
and unlike those cheap ones these will mate and disengage smoothly.another factor is the strain reliefs at each end . 
those keep the conductors from fraying or breaking inside the cable , which will often occur at cable ends on cables without them.of course the color coding is a godsend . 
i can now tell at a glance what is connected to what , both live and in my home studio . 
i have not experienced any extraneous noise using these , but i am careful to eliminate sources or route around them . 
still , these are as good as any other cables i have purchased.i 'll also admit that price initially entered into my buying decision . 
i was frankly concerned that at the price point these would turn out to be junk . 
not the case . 
i can happily say that sometimes you really do get more than you pay for . 
these cables have been solid ; we use them in the studio every single day , and have held up so well compared to many others i 've ordered for less.yes , $ 70 on cables seems like a boring way to spend that money , but do n't be fooled : nothing makes you looks stupider during a recording session than a blown cable . 
not only do these hold up and sound great , i 've found that when working with a complicated studio setup , i 'm always surprised how helpful the color-coding actually ends up being . 
for the price , this is totally worth it.i use these with the following to really color code my studio setup : color windscreens : gls audio mic windscreens microphonecolor electrical tape : b004zzvhgwcolor patch cables : b003vybnhgdefinitely worth it ! 
makes a huge difference ! 
ok , so i had to buy another item because 2 items in my cart were `` add-on '' items . 
i needed another microphone and i had been toying with the idea of purchasing a gls mic . 
i 'm extremely happy i took the chance , and as soon as i submit this review , i 'm purchasing another . 
this is the best price/value purchase i 've made in a long time . 
i 'm not going to insult your intelligence and say it 's the same as the other well-known mic that looks the same , but for my ears and everybody else who 's listened to this mic , it sounds clear and clean and is a little hotter than my sm 58 . 
i just used it to play a show on friday the 24th , and it performed wonderfully . 
the sound guy thought it was an sm 58 . 
i will definitely buy a couple of the es-57s as well to mic up some amps . 
now , things may change in a year if the mic does n't hold up , but it is hefty and solid , and seems to be built like a tank . 
now , if i was dripping money , maybe i would stick with the `` industry standard , '' but when you can buy these at a 3:1 dollar ratio , why on earth should i ? 
2/6/2014 update : i must say that in some venues , you 'll really have to tweak the eq in order to stop feedback . 
so while they are a great value , they feedback in some situations where my sennheisers do not -lrb- but they were 4 times the price ... -rrb- . 
love the on and off switch and the sound is great with little or no feedback , would purchase this mic again . 
these are great xlr cables . 
we run them form our board to our mains and they are excellent ! 
i have several gls cables and have zero complaints . 
i scored a virtually unused pre-owned unit for $ 50 . 
it is packed with features and there is a little bit of a learning curve if you want to really make use of the features , but simple plug and play operation is possible . 
my original thought was to use the unit as an interface for recording on my pc . 
my only gripe - and it is considerable - is that the unit sounds too digital to me - particularly as the chord or note starts to decay and fade . 
i probably would have loved this thing when i started playing -lrb- more years ago than i care to admit -rrb- . 
i prefer a genuine tube driven amp with analog pedals . 
does that make me a ` gear snob ' ? 
not when you consider that low watt tube amps and cheaply manufactured pedals can be had for peanuts these days ;-rrb- i 've also owned a tech 21 trademark 60 analog modeling amp -lrb- not bad but traded -rrb- and still have a tech 21 tri ac analog preamp -lrb- great pedal and a keeper -rrb- - both are ` modelers ' and both sounded better to my ears than digital modelers . 
i just prefer analog all the way around . 
i eventually gave the unit away to someone who has just taken up the guitar . 
he likes it fine - i gave 3 stars because it 's a good way for junior to experement with effects and to practice without annoying the neighbors . 
the good : this is a good tool to practice guitar with headphones.the bad : the tones are not good by any stretch of the imagination , unless you like hyper-distorted noise . 
the cleans sound artificial and the crunch tones have obvious digital distortion applied . 
the effects are hit and miss as well . 
plate reverb is decent but spring reverb is so artificial sounding that it 's downright offensive.throw in the fact it chews through batteries , the software interface you use to program it on your computer is really difficult to use , and how it loses its small-and-portable-factor with a guitar cable , headphone cable , and power adapter plugged into it , i 'd be hard-pressed to recommend this product unless you really need to practice through headphones . 
i 've been using a one spot to power a gator small pedalboard for about 8 years now . 
in that time i 've done probably over 200 gigs and i 've never had a problem . 
is it super quiet ? 
no , but when you have pedals and amps with gain and single coil pickups , there will be noise . 
it 's a fact of life . 
i 've never found it to be excessive . 
turn the volume on your guitar all the way down when you 're not playing.i would recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable solution to powering their pedalboard . 
i like this for getting rid of all those extra adaptors you have to have a special power strip for , and it works well for most of my ibanez , mxr and boss pedals that have an outside adaptor socket . 
it does n't seem to work so well with my vox wah , my old mxr distortion plus and my fulltone pedals . 
i 'm using the 9v battery adaptor for the wah and my dist + , and i get a really weird random squealy noise from the wah -lrb- not the same one you get when the wah is not playing well with another pedal in your chain -rrb- and intermittant operating problems with the dist + . 
i get a slightly louder hum from the fulltone pedals when they 're on , but my newer boss/ibanez/mxr pedals have no issues at all . 
the one spot is not a regulated power supply -lrb- if it was , they 'd say so -rrb- , so maybe that 's the culprit ; not sure . 
this seems like a good product . 
it is working well for me and the chord is super long which is great . 
too long is better than too short !! 
bought this to power all my stomp boxes , wha peddle , tuner etc. . 
works just fine . 
in fact , bought a 2nd one that stays on my workbench for powering various items being tested or worked on . 
has all the adapters i needed . 
im using this with five pedals and it works great . 
no added noise , no signal loss , and saves the cost and hassle of constantly replacing 9v batteries.comes with a nice assortment of adapters for use with just about any brand of pedal out there.probably not the most durable power supply available , but for the price , it cant be beat . 
on the plus side it does the job , powers your 9v pedals and does n't break the bank ... on the down side this unit can be a bit noisy depending on which wall socket you have to plug into . 
neon lighting can raise hell with this power supply ... but who ever said playing out live was gon na be easy ? 
best to have a noise gate handy ... just in case . 
ive been using this item for about 3 weeks now , and i love it . 
i have a homemade pedalboard , the one spot combo is good for it cause its kept me from having to mount a power supply on the board . 
i power 7 pedals and absolutely no noise distortion comes from the pedals with this hooked up , if anything it sounds better than a battery , for sure . 
i 'd read a lot about the one spot power system . 
i needed 220v power overseas and so i ordered this . 
it is truly a very nice product and amazingly quiet . 
i currently have some high end power bricks on my two larger pedal boards ... i may swamp them out fo this one . 
highly recommend it . 
great useful product well made quite , and lots of use to view of my floor effects , works great , , and no other noise from it , buy it . 
i was new to pedal effects , new to pedal boards , and new to the challenge of how to power it all . 
i did my research and settled on pedal train for the board -lrb- the mini , with case -rrb- and the one spot for power . 
this bundle -- including an 8-pedal chain , a few adapters and the power supply -- does it all . 
in fact , it may be overkill . 
i only have 5 pedals , so i have to hide/secure the rest of the chain with twist ties . 
and the adapters , never used 'em . 
but it is a complete kit . 
if you need more than this , i do n't know what to tell ya . 
i have this hooked up to 4 pedals so far and it 's awesome . 
real cost saver on batteries . 
you really cant go wrong for the price . 
i got this by mistake , confusing it with the tremolo affect . 
but , either way , i liked it and decided to keep it . 
it 's a really good deal at the price . 
and it sounds just as good as major brands . 
the only problem most people find is the material that it 's made of . 
it 's like a hard plastic , not metal like most are . 
but , if you 're not a person who abuses your gear , it should last you a good while.i can not use it for recording , because there is some hiss from it , like all other behringer pedals , and i record direct , not through amp . 
but , for live playing , it 's great . 
it 's especially perfect for garage and bar bands . 
this should be your first pedal . 
for 50 bucks you get every affect accept distortion . 
no other pedal comes close to delivering more bang for the buck . 
it 's clean , high fidelity , and versatile as a swiss army knife . 
although not through amazon.com , i recently purchased a seagull s6 original acoustic guitar . 
i compared this with a variety of other brands in the price range , as well as with the seagull entourage acoustic-electric which was also in the general price range . 
the s6 has a nicely consistent tone which , although maybe a little too bright for some players ' tastes , projects very well . 
some reviewers and guitarists with whom i 've talked wonder how seagull can produce instruments that sound as well as they do in north america for the price . 
i think that i found part of the answer when i looked inside some of the seagulls . 
the braces do not look as uniform and neatly finished as they might on other guitars . 
looking at the outside of the guitar and listening to it , though , you 'd never know . 
i find the 1.8 '' neck width at the nut to be great for fingerpicking work and left-hand fingering . 
it 's a compromise between a more standard acoustic neck width and a classical guitar neck width . 
for me , it works . 
some players who are more used to a more traditionally narrow neck might not appreciate this attribute of the guitar . 
seagull does offer other models , by the way , that have a more traditional width . 
the slightly shorter scale reminds me of the scale gibson uses on many of its electric guitar models : just shorter enough to better enable chord fingering , but not so short as to cause floppy strings . 
i could n't be happier with the seagull s6 , especially for the price ! 
i personally think this seagull is over rated . 
a lot of reviewers are covering the muddy -lrb- not crisp -rrb- sound as &#34; mellow &#34; i do n't think so . 
i have over 115 guitars in my collection , and around 15 of them are acoustics.i have nothing against seagull , or canada , but bought one of these new off the rave reviews , and just recently -lrb- i have had both thes6 and fgx730 for five years -rrb- pulled the s6 out for another try just because i could not make myself believe it sounded worse thanmy used yamaha ; it did!side by side i went through the chords on each guitar , and had to finally come to the conclusion that the seagull had to go.with a price tag of $ 420.00 for the s6 , and $ 282.00 for it 's yamaha equal , the fg730s , unless you just feel like throwing yourmoney away , i would stay away from this guitar , and look elsewhere.oh , by the way , i have an s6 for sale ! 
i bought this guitar in 2005 . 
it sounds and looks wonderful and manages to stay that way . 
i think this is a good guitar and when you think that something that might sound better would cost three to four times as much it is a great guitar for the value.this model has the cedar top . 
i love that sound vs the more typical spruce top on flattop guitars . 
it is a bit more mellow and has a hint of a classical guitar tone because of that . 
if you prefer the bright concert sound of a martin then you 'll not want this cedar top.yes this guitar has an oiled finish . 
this allows the soundboard to really sing unimpeded . 
it also allows you to knock the heck out of it . 
funny thing is that after five years there is n't much damage just a little arm wear . 
i think you 'll like this guitar enough to not knock it around.the neck feels silky smooth . 
the frets are well placed and do n't stab you by hanging over the neck a little which is what you 'll get in other guitars in this price range . 
paying to get the frets filed down is an additional expense on those competitors so beware when comparing.this does n't come with a case so i bought a hard shell by the brand name `` canadian '' . 
great case.when i bought it it really did n't need an adjustment but i took it to a local shop to make it perfect for me . 
i 've also taken it in every other year for setting the action - checking and tweaking the neck - and getting the frets polished . 
i also use a humidifier in its case during the winter months in chicago . 
performing these tasks will prolong the life of your seagull and your enjoyment of it . 
-------------------- update : 10/13/2012 update of my 2010 review . 
this guitar sounds even better . 
i went to a handful of guitar stores looking for another acoustic `` just for fun '' and i had a few bucks burning a hole in my pocket . 
to my surprise all the guitars three times its price sounded vastly inferior . 
you see i learned that as you play a good wood guitar that over time it will `` open up '' and keep sounding better . 
yet another reason to keep it humidified and taken care of . 
it will increase in value -lrb- to you at least -rrb- . 
i take this thing out of my rig every once in awhile , but it always finds its way back in . 
unlike kaga , i put it at the end of my chain , right before a boss line selector , for multiple amps . 
i used to put it at the beginning of my chaing , during my metal days , and it does well there too . 
i 'm more blues orientated now , and love it at the end . 
with my fuzzes i can have them cracked and nice and lightly smooth , then at the end with the eq , i got it jacked up ! 
unlike most people i love a bass players v on my eq . 
i love that bass , but i play through 10 's and 15 's and those speakers handle it better than 12 's , although i do have a 2x12 with v30 's in it and it sounds nice . 
this is a must have pedal though , no matter what you want your sound to end up like , if you have crapy stuf and just need an edge or really nice stuff and looking for that last bit of tone , you got it with this thing . 
bottom line up front : if you play an orange , vox , or marshall , you do n't necessarily * need * an eq pedal , but putting one in your signal chain will take your amp to the next level.why is this ? 
well , the brits design their amps with wide and musical eq but the overall frequency response is narrow . 
this has led many british amp manufacturers to include specialized tone shaping buttons on the control panel because they are well aware that british eq is n't as dramatic as american guitarists want it to be . 
there is nothing wrong with this by any means - it 's just an overall characteristic of british amplifiers.secondly , any tube amp loves to be pushed with boost and dirt pedals to get extra crispy overdrive from the clean channel - since distortion channels on tube amps have a tendency to compress and limit the output slightly . 
this pedal is more than capable of providing that boost . 
+15 db seems to be right amount to push clean to dirty , or dirty to overdrive , or overdrive to distortion.live performance : if you 're in a rock band that plays small venues like bars and clubs , you 've probably noticed that most bands have overwhelming bass/midrange noise -lrb- 100 ~ 500hz -rrb- that drowns out the vocals and clarity of the drums or any instrument for that matter . 
applying eq to your signal chain will allow you to clean up your tone by cutting some unnecessary low-end from the picture and boosting your high-end for better clarity.recording direct-in : if you 're using this pedal with a di box or simply plugging directly into your audio interface for virtual reamping , you 'll be able to get a more balanced signal if you want to darken your strat or brighten your les paul.why 4 stars ? 
yes , the noise . 
it 's not bothersome by any means , but if you 're recording with a mic 'd amp or direct in , you will absolutely need a noise suppressor . 
i use my ge-7 with the boss ns-2 , and the ns-2 completely removes the white noise generated from the ge-7 . 
the result is an amazing , clean boosting eq.if you 're on the fence ... go ahead and get this thing . 
you wo n't regret it . 
it 's not just for tone snobs , it can really make cheap gear sound way better , and take great gear to the next level . 
i 've had this pedal since the mid-90 's , when i started playing in my teens . 
while an eq might seem like an odd choice for a beginner 's pedal selection , i was mainly trying to compensate for the crappy bass and mid-range of the cheap crate and marshall amps i used back then . 
since i have better equipment now , i have n't used it as much.however , as simple as it is , it is definitely a useful tool . 
you can leave it on all the time to mold your sound with greater detail than most amps would have with knobs . 
or , you can the on-board volume to crank up the volume for solos or louder parts.the only negatives i recall from using it were that it added a bit of a hissing noise -lrb- but not so much that you could n't trap it with a noise gate -rrb- , and it seemed to take away from the sustain of notes just a bit . 
again , nothing that ca n't be fixed with other effects . 
and if you think about how important equalization is with stereo equipment , it only makes sense that you might want that level of control in a guitar amp as well.i give it 5 * despite the minor flaws because it does what it says and boss products are built rock solid . 
i 'll have this thing forever . 
so if you want to play just in your garage this is really good for the price.i like it , it 's ok , the sound is kind of a cold distortion . 
if you like warm sounds you should see something else . 
very nice tone , very nice metal sound , very crunchy and deep . 
well worth it for the price , on par with other way more expensive pedals . 
definetly buy the power supply with it though , it just makes it better and easier to use . 
very nice product overall it has great sound and distorts like its suppose to.i have been needing one for a long time.thanks beringer usa so many tones to choose from with the variable frequency eq and a nice range of distortion makes this a killer deal . 
it sounds very artificial , i remember first getting this pedal and really loving the sound and kick it had , now that i use it with a better amp , it sounds very processed and artificial in sound that it 's not even worth the price i payed for it before . 
i also had bought another one to replace the first one because the input section jack got messed up in the amp that it did n't want to lock with my guitar cable and when i took it apart , there was no way for me to fix it other than sending it to be replaced . 
shitty pedal . 
excellent value for the money although not any more heavy duty than other stands i own . 
nice and stable for my classical guitar . 
using this for a prs electric guitar with satisfactory results . 
easy to set up . 
sturdy enough for repeated use . 
no worries about using this with an expensive instrument . 
simply put , it 's well made and works great . 
ordered a few of these ... should come in different sizes ... but for the price these are fine ... keep em in every case ... enjoy . . 
will buy again works great with or without polish . 
it is a good size and the ziplock bag it comes in keeps the polish i use from drying out . 
it is just as described , i am happy ! 
amazon always comes through , without a hitch , it was delivered as usual before stated time ! 
i bought these xlr cables for my mobile dj rig and they perform flawlessly . 
the contruction is of high grade material and the signal is of studio quality . 
buy with confidence . 
i am no audio file , but these do the job and i like the colors.i did buy some more expensive magami ones and i ca n't tell a difference . 
i purchased these cables for my behringer 802 mixer & mxl 770 mic and these cables are perfect ! 
finally get to have quality sounding tracks knowing i have the professional cables to back me up ! 
the best xlr cables you can find . 
hands down . 
these cable are perfect !! 
i 've bought much more expensive cable that did n't have the quality of these . 
they even had velcro -lrb- re-useable tape to hold them 2 each -rrb- . 
i bought the ts version of these cables , and they have served me well , these are of the same quality , and a great value for the price . 
i 'm a new user , but seem to be a great product !!!! ca n't complaint !!! 
i finally got it and saw how great it is . 
it has plenty of roomy pockets , great padding , and is put together with great quality . 
this bag is made well enough . 
if you are careful it offers good protection . 
you ca n't rely on this bag alone if you are going to toss the guitar around and you certainly ca n't stack anything on it but it will prevent dings and scratches from occasional bumps etc. . 
if your guitar is priceless than you should upscale your gig bag , otherwise it 's a good bag , especially at this price . 
its pretty delayed , and does n't display the notes for very long , but i play in drop g , and it gets the job done . 
the construction is n't something i wan na step on , but in a bag its better than paying $ 100 look at this pedal . 
look at what it does , and what it costs . 
$ 30 for a tuner in a pedal form factor , and that 's if you do n't even try to hunt down a lower price . 
by contrast , boss 's tu-2 is essentially the same thing in a more durable housing , and it costs $ 100 retail.yes , the housing is made of plastic . 
i do n't know about you , but i generally wo n't be leaping with both feet onto my tuner in the middle of a set . 
if you treat your gear with any respect whatsoever , it should survive . 
and if it does n't , so what ? 
it 's cheap to replace.the other person on here obviously got a faulty model , which happens . 
mine 's developed a touchy input jack over time -lrb- it 's actually the earlier tu-100 model -rrb- , but i do n't know that it 's totally unexpected on a pedal this cheap . 
one star off for these kinds of quality control problems , just to be fair . 
i own three other behringer pedals as well , and they 're still going strong.a tuner is an essential part of any musician 's rig , and this does the job just fine . 
use the money you save towards buying a really nice stompbox that will actually effect your sound while playing.update : after having used a new tuning pedal for some time , i will admit that , yes , this is a subpar tuner . 
however , i still stand by my original opinion that for the amount of money you pay , this is n't a bad investment . 
for a guitarist just starting out , this would still make a good first tuner when you really want to spend your money on pedals that will effect your sound . 
this workk well however i do get some residual noise that causes the meter to shift to to flat side of the range . 
i may need new cables . 
it 's not as nice as my audio technica one but this does the job and i 'm happy . 
a little flimsier than the at but at the price it 's good . 
in my experience these cables were not great . 
the connectors rattle , they are made of cheap materials and the cable subsequently had a ton of line noise . 
i ca n't expect miracles at that price-point but i certainly expected better . 
i avoid this brand of cables . 
when i purchased this pedal from a local music store i was n't even looking for a double pedal set , but for a replacement for the pedal that came with my tama stagestar kit . 
during my quest for a pedal that had the feel i wanted i sat behind a pacific drum kit that had these pedals . 
at first i ignored the second bass pedal and played a bit with just the right pedal and hi-hat . 
i liked the feel of the right pedal and was about to ask if the store had it in a single pedal configuration when i decided to see what it was like playing double . 
wow - it immediately expanded my range and opened up a plethora of possibilities.this pedal is nearly infinitely adjustable , especially cam rotation , spring tension , and beater offset . 
most of the adjustments require a hex wrench , which is fairly standard for most modern single and double pedals . 
the left side slave pedal has a full floorplate , and the linkage rod that connects the right and left pedals will not bind at any angle i have tried . 
there is a slight lag on the left pedal , which is normal for any double pedal configuration , but you 'll quickly compensate for that as you get used to a double pedal if you are moving from a single pedal.before i purchased this particular model i tried out tama 's iron cobra , pearl 's powershifter and a gilbralter avenger . 
i did not like the stiffness of the iron cobra , but did like the pearl and gibraltar pedals . 
it finally came down to either this or the gibralter , which was slightly smoother , but significantly more expensive . 
i opted for best value without sacrificing performance or quality and am thrilled with this pedal.if you are moving from a single to double pedal configuration i strongly recommend that you give this one a serious look . 
more importantly , try out this pedal in a local store and compare it to other double models - selecting a bass pedal is a personal decision with many more factors than price , features and quality . 
it has to feel right . 
in addition , you will find that you will be using the double bass more than your hi-hat , which means that you will need to compensate . 
for that i recommend the gibraltar hi-hat drop clutch -lrb- asin b0002f73yy -rrb- , which will allow you to engage and disengage your hi-hat with ease . 
i have my hi-hats set for a slight opening in the normal closed position , but stepping on the hi-hat pedal - using the clutch - puts it in full play position . 
tapping the lever on the clutch closes them again . 
this clutch is a perfect companion to a double bass pedal ! 
i bought this unit for a friend , and i could compare with others overdrives i already have . 
i think the mxr badass custom modified overdrive or way huge green rhino are better choise . 
there is a reason this is the number one best selling guitar affect pedal on the market . 
the tube screamer just works . 
:--rrb- to start , as the full name of this pedal would indicate , this pedal is for tube amps . 
i ca n't comment on how it 'll sound for a hybrid , and my experience is that it 's definitely not for solid state . 
distortion pedals go much better with solid state . 
further , tube screamers are n't meant to take your tube amp from clean to high gain ; again , that 's what a distortion pedal will do . 
tube screamers in general are designed to drive your tubes a little harder , and are most commonly used as a solo boost . 
tube screamers are in the category of `` overdrive '' pedals , and like the name would indicate , they 're meant add a little extra `` over '' an already `` driven '' amp , but in a more natural , smooth , organic way then a distortion pedal would.however , the ibanez ts-9dx does more than your typical tube screamer . 
the extra knob that switches between ts9 , + , hot , and turbo mode adds a whole lot of tone and use options . 
let me expound : i play hard rock and metal through a bugera 1990 head -lrb- basically a marshall jcm 900 -rrb- and cab with celestion vintage 30 speakers . 
while that amp does have a fair amount of gain and bass on tap , it 's not quite enough to accurately get more modern tones unaided . 
a standard ibanez ts-9 or some other knock-off tube screamer will not be able to get an amp like mine into more modern , heavier tones , because standard tube screamers also slightly cut bass and add some mids , again , to help solos cut through the mix . 
but the extra knob on the ibanez ts9dx solves this problem . 
by switching to + , hot , or turbo mode , the pedal adds bass and a little extra gain incrementally . 
i like the '' + '' setting the best . 
so the way i use this pedal is that i 'll set my amp for my standard crunchy rhythm tone with the gain on the amp already fairly high . 
then , for the songs that utilize a little heavier sound , i 'll kick on my ts9dx , with the drive pretty low -lrb- 9 o'clock -rrb- , volume at 12 o'clock , tone about 1 o'clock , and + mode . 
with these settings it increases the bass and general thickness of my tone , and adds a little gain and volume . 
so it 's basically like adding another channel to my amp.i will add one detail that might make or break this pedal for you : tubescreamers in general , and certainly this ibanez ts-9dx , add mid-range to your tone automatically . 
and you ca n't dial it out . 
the regular ts-9 mode adds some low mids , and a little more high mids . 
the other modes add more low mids in particular , which in part contribute to the overall `` thickness '' to the tone , which can be great . 
but if you 're after a scooped mid sound , say for metal , then i would only recommend this pedal as a solo boost , where the mids will help cut through the mix.in conclusion , it 's probably safe to say that most people who buy tubescreamers are probably playing blues of some sort and are just looking to boost their volume and maybe add a little dirt . 
and yes , this pedal will do that . 
so will the bbe greenscreamer , behringer tube overdrive , mxr distortion plus , boss sd-1 , digitech bad monkey , or several other ibanez tube screamer pedal variations . 
but by adding the turbo-mode options , the ibanez ts-9dx will work for the hard rock and metal players -lrb- depending on the exact style -rrb- in a way that these plethora of other options wo n't . 
consider the distortion sound of cream , the doors , and zz top . 
that buzzy , psychedelic type sound is what this pedal does . 
unfortunately , that 's about all it does . 
however , if you want to have the perfect `` break on through '' guitar intro sound , this is absolutely the pedal for you . 
quality-wise it 's awesome , and if i needed that sound i would definitely own one again . 
i got rid of mine to purchase some other gear that served a wider variety of functions , and honestly i have n't missed it , because i 'm not in a doors cover band or anything . 
leeeeeeeeeet meeeeee saaaaaaay thiiiis iiiis nooooot liiiiiiiiike whaaaaaat iiiii thooooought . 
wow almost like the opposite it is like a violin sound or mock reverse single delay sound . 
got ta love the slow moe i bought this affect because i saw a few youtube demos that made it look pretty good . 
i had always wanted an attack delay affect and the behringer slow motion was priced well below all competitors . 
when it arrived , i tested it thoroughly and found that it is tricky to learn and limited in scope . 
it only works well under these circumstances : all notes must be played slowly , individually and deliberately in order for the attack delay affect to kick in . 
you ca n't play a quick series of notes and expect the affect to work properly . 
having said that , i found that the affect is nice , once you have mastered the technique . 
i tried to use it in conjunction with overdrive and sustain pedals and it did not work well at all . 
other reviewers have suggested using it with a digital or analog delay pedal , which i have not tried . 
i considered returning the unit to amazon for a refund , but i do n't think that would be fair as it does work to some extent and it did n't cost me a lot of money in the first place . 
however , i do not think i would recommend it to a friend . 
buy this . 
it 's cheap and better than fuzz pedals that cost 6 times as much . 
it can go from a clean boost to a slight octave up fuzz that has to be heard ... amazing sounds ! 
nice features on a pedal this cheap . 
i like the capacity to independently control treble and bass . 
switch actually works and makes a marked difference in the pedal . 
not the bulletproof construction of a boss pedal , but i have quite a few behringer pedals and i 've yet to have a malfunction in more than a year . 
i have an eh big muff , and this pedal is closer to that than to a dunlop fuzz face . 
for this price , it 's another great tool for your arsenal . 
one thing to keep in mind with any pedal that is not true bypass - if you string a bunch of them together , you are going to experience the dreaded ` tone suck ' . 
if most of your pedals are true bypass or have a high quality buffered bypass , you will be fine . 
this strap is very comfortable ! 
love how it just velcros right over my strap without having to remove it from guitar . 
it does slide around some and has to be adjusted every time i put it on but is so worth the final result . 
i have to admit . 
i have not tried this pedal with any other guitar besides my strats . 
but this pedal gives me everything that i want.the best way that i can describe the sound of the ocd is quality and character.as a clean drivewhen you uses this pedal with less drive as a clean boost for your tube amp , you will notice that it delivers a very strong character from your guitar and is very sensitive to your dynamics while playing.as an overdrivei have loved the ibanez ts9 because it allows a strat to keep a vocal type of midrange while having singing trebles . 
when you add drive to the ts9 , it retains those characteristics which is why it is the industry standard for strat guitarists who want to keep their stratty character and get the quality sound of a tube amp.the reason why the ocd is my preferred pedal over the ts9 is that it does not let the low end distort as early . 
the ts9 allows you lower notes to distort earlier and seems to then amplify the signal . 
the ocd gives you the fattest low end with tons of tone . 
if you like blues or hard rock , you will notice that this feature is exactly what you wanted to give your playing a really strong character . 
you gain boldness and when your low end does gain some crunch , it is the biggest baddest tone that you could dream of.i use this pedal with my hss strat and through a blues jr iii and use the clean boost for the coolest clean tone ever . 
it allows your playing dynamics to drive the amp , not some arbitrary clipping from your pedal . 
when i am playing heavier blues or rock stuff , i just turn up the drive and have the boldest and highest quality sound that i have ever played with.the hp/lp switchshifting into hp is almost like a gain boost . 
i have heard it described as switching from an american fender-y sound -lrb- lp -rrb- to a british marshall-y sound -lrb- hp -rrb- . 
i guess this is a decent description . 
i have found that i get a thick ballsy sound in the lp and i do n't lose any quality in the hp . 
it feels like you get a boost in your midrange.to conclude , i would have to say that this pedal is the perfect mix of ballsy overdrive with quality tone . 
if you have a quality amp and a quality guitar , there is no reason to try and save $ 30 by buying an ibanez ts9 or ts808 or ts9dx . 
this pedal will make you a lot happier than those will if you like to keep your low end intact and not allow it to break up too early making it whimpy . 
i 've never been much of an affect pedal guy ; lots of batteries and cables when i can just get a good tone direct into my fender tweed . 
i 've recently conceded to using more effects and have gone , quite frankly , hog wild on new gear . 
this is the best of the pedal purchases i have made so far , it 's not quite the mxr sound i was going for but there 's definitely something here . 
the boost works very well for lead work and really ups the sustain on my strat.just two controls , one for volume , one for compression . 
my only concern is that the knobs feel like they could be much more sturdy , i have n't pulled them off yet but i would guess the pots have plastic posts as opposed to metal ones . 
i do own a few behringer pedals and many are very good sounding for their price range , and this pedal will stay in my collection.i 've spent $ 200 + for a few of my pedals , but i order and try many other pedals within the same effects range , because some i believe are just to costly for what you get , and the sound quality usually are not that far apart.i would put this pedal in that category . 
this is my 1st compressor pedal and while i dint think i really needed this type of pedal , for the price i thought i would give it a try ... wow ! 
the behringer dc9 dynamics compressor pedal greatly enhances the sounds of every other pedal on my pedal-board , plus i get a volume control knob that allows me to drop my amp output level to below where to amp is set . 
so i can go quiet on an apartment at late hours , with a 100 watt amp , that 's nice.so i would say the majority of people will absolutely love this pedal . 
cost efficient . 
perfect for a guitarist who loses or wears out picks easily . 
like it alot . 
will probably buy more next year ;-rrb- to me , there 's not too much depth you can go into when describing guitar picks . 
either they feel good in your hand , or they do n't . 
either they kind of &#34; disappear &#34; when you 're playing , or they feel like a hindrance . 
these dunlops get it just right . 
enough grip to where you 're not fumbling all over the place , and they somehow get out of the way of your playing . 
they 're right up there with the fender classic picks , as my all-time favorites to use . 
hands down my absolute favorite pick . 
i have tried many brands , materials & various thicknesses but i always come home to the dunlop tortext red .50 mm ! 
these picks are great , the best part is the 72 pack . 
i always have spares . 
this is a thicker pick , i would recomend you actualy try one before you by 72 of them . 
the only complaint comes from my wife , since they tend to pop up all over the house ! 
i 'm a beginner guitar player going on intermediate and i 've quickly learned that anything from jim dunlop is quality stuff . 
works well . 
the glass is a much softer , more subtle sound than metal . 
it works on my pinky finger . 
would have to have a much larger one for my ring finger and i dont have particularly large hands . 
just do n't drop one of these on you tile floor . 
they explore quite nicely that way . 
i keep mine in a protective case when i am not using it . 
very nice guitar slide . 
the glass is nice , slides very well on my electric and acoustic , and it fits like a mitten . 
a must for every serious guitar player . 
this is one of the easiest to use slides that i have ever owned & i have been playing for about 45 years . 
i play mostly classic rock & this slide is a handy gadget to have in your guitar case.this holds up very well because i have a way of abusing a slide . 
dunlop does it again . 
i 'm not much of a slide player but i figure every guitarist should at least own one of these . 
just do n't drop it on the floor like i did with the last one i had . 
i found the price on amazon cheaper than my local guitar shop and quickly bought it . 
the slide works smoother than a brass slide on an acoustic/electric guitar and also sounds great with a cigar box guitar with piezo pickup . 
the slide is thick and the large size fits well on the middle , ring and pinky finger.i found the tone of both guitars brighter and more defined using this slide compared to a brass slide which suits an electric guitar better imo . 
i have not tried a ceramic slide with any guitar , but a dunlop ceramic slide is most likely a future purchase.jim dunlop products are solid and last long for the most part , their slides seem to be the most popular brand aside for boutique bottle slides and i think this one will last a long time . 
for what it 's supposed to do , it works very well . 
i also have the medium size and that one fits a bit better i think . 
this is still usable , but it is for very big fingers . 
i think i have slightly fatter fingers than the average guy out there , but this still leaves some extra room . 
either way , it works well . 
it feels very sturdy and i 'm not worried about it cracking anytime soon . 
for the price , it 's a must have . 
this is my first slide , i never use slide to play my guitar , look good size is right for me . 
i just have to learn how to use it ;--rrb- these cans were decent , back when they were just above 100 bucks . 
they 've inflated to 160 and that 's just ridiculous . 
there is better in this price range . 
the srh840 's for example on ebay for 120 ~ bucks new , does everything better than these cans . 
the m50 's have really punchy bass , and extremely stringent highs , they 're very loose in the low end , and their mids are recessed . 
that combination makes for a fatally tiring listening experience . 
the pads are pleather and terribly uncomfortable , whilst having an almost starchy texture to them . 
the headband clamps onto larger heads and lacks decent padding underneath . 
these phones are also terrible in regards to any soundstage at all , which means for gaming , these will be pretty terrible . 
they do some ... some ... new genres alright , but their extremely aggressive presentation makes these phones just hard to listen to . 
they also ca n't do lighter genres like jazz and classical due to their poor positoning . 
there are much much better monitors in this price range than these , the shure srh840 as i 've said before totally outclass these headphones in all areas.stay away , do n't fall victim to the noob hype . 
i 've been using sennheiser 's for years and while i am very pleased with them i decided to try the ath-m50ss on a whim . 
i spent a little more -lrb- $ 50 -rrb- than what i 've been paying for the sennies but it was well worth it . 
i get more of a flat response which is exactly what i needed for monitoring my audio mixes.and a trivial bonus ... a straight cord . 
i hate coiled cords . 
if your goal is to use these for mixing , then just hit the buy button.i have about 6 sets of various headphones from low end to nice gamer phones , and these will allow you to hear sounds that your other phones will not.i use these to mix down multi-track audio and then compare the final mix with a set of regular monitors . 
i mix and master all my own music on these guys . 
before the audiophiles try to stone me to death , listen ! 
i cant have giant krk monitors blasting in my small apartment , but what i can have is a solid pair of affordable headphones that present my music in a very true light . 
these are not beats by dre , they will not make all your songs have super bass , and they are n't a great fashion statement ; however , they are work horses and will show you how your music really sounds . 
nicer headphones exist , true , but these are the best in their price range in my opinion . 
i 've owned these for several years and found them sufficient for mixing purposes -- so long as i keep using reference songs for comparison ... that 's because by themselves , the ath-m50 do n't have a flat frequency response . 
they 're flatter than most phones under a hundred , but you will find that they 're a bit too middy and lacking in lower treble regions compared with a good set of studio monitors.fortunately , i found that this deficiency can be fixed with a corrective eq curve . 
load up a parametric eq and do the following : -lsb- +1 db @ 80hz q of 5 -rsb- , -lsb- +1.5 db @ 350hz q of 2 -rsb- , -lsb- -2.5 db @ 1khz q of 1 -rsb- , -lsb- +1 db @ 3khz q of 1 -rsb- , -lsb- +2 db @ 6.5 khz q of 3.5 -rsb- , and -lsb- +1.5 db @ 15khz q of 3 -rsb- . 
save this as a preset.if you listen to reference songs with this , you 'll find a more pleasing , balanced , 3d kind of sound compared to the original . 
i base this correction curve on published frequency response graphs of the ath-m50 . 
the proof that this worked is that now these headphones sound a lot like my good studio monitors . 
they translate better with the correction curve active.the bass on these is solid and seems to go down to 20hz or so , more felt than heard . 
subsonic thumps feel like head motion more than sound . 
this is where these headphones are better than studio monitors , unless you have a well treated room with a good sub . 
i therefore use these headphones to adjust bass , in relation to the reference songs . 
i also use them for editing slight sounds -lrb- pops , clicks -rrb- and getting reverb tails right , and with help panning tracks -- they are very good for this , like a magnifying glass.the foam pads and black ` paint ' on the headband will crack and fall off after 2 years . 
i wrapped black sports tape around the headband , works well . 
replacement pads can be bought on amazon . 
so the padding material coating could have been better made . 
that plus the middy frequency response is why i give 4 stars instead of 5 . 
but i still think they 're the best headphones for mixing and tracking under a couple hundred . 
i 've had this pedal for over a year now and i 've been getting more and more into tube amps and i 've learned to appreciate how the intricacies of how all of this gear works together -lrb- amps , guitars and pedals -rrb- . 
when i first reviewed this pedal , i had just gotten a new solid state amp and i was very let down . 
after i jumped to tube amps , i grew to appreciate it a little bit more , but i was using it wrong ; i 'd just match the output of my amp and goose the distortion level to use it as a 2nd channel/gain stage . 
i thought it lent a good distorted tone to my playing , but i dismissed it as just an `` ok '' box.flash forward : this thing kills ! 
it belongs in front of a tube amp ; period . 
i 've found , as all before me , that dirt boxes are virtually useless on solid state amps.the d iii works very well as a clean boost : max the volume , set tone to taste and the roll the distortion all the way back . 
this will blast your clean amp into overdrive , without much coloration on your tone . 
this is my preferred setting as i can use it to push my single channel tube amps into dirty territory like i would before , using it as a second channel , but with that natural tube sound . 
any pedal that gives you some more `` umph '' without altering the original sound of your amp is a beautiful thing.dial the output down some , and crank the volume on the amp a bit more , the distortion knob really adds some nice saturated gain that increases sustain and can creep up on getting a significantly dirtier tone . 
i found that this is reminiscent of a classic tube screamer ; while not tonally identical , this can really help push a hotter amp into overdrive to get some heavy , heavy tones , while retaining the sound of the amp 's natural distortion.in between , you can dial in some classic crunch tones suitable for rock and blues or just a smooth overdrive . 
after playing around with the knobs , i found that this is a very versatile and well voiced pedal . 
i actually prefer it to tube screamers and its clones as that 's been done to death ; the d iii is conceptually the same , but it just sounds `` different '' that the ts and it does n't let go of the low end.for the price , this is a fantastic buy . 
it delivers enough output to be used as a fantastic clean boost , and there 's enough gain on tap to dial in just about any rock tone you 'd want , save for modern high gain metal . 
mxr make pretty good pedals for the money . 
i thought that this would be a high output , saturated type distortion . 
it is not . 
it has plent of volume , which is good for boosting . 
but , even with the gain knob turned all the way up , this thing is an overdrive . 
which is not a bad thing , if that 's what you are looking for . 
very mid-rangey sound as well . 
just not for me . 
but it 's well built and would make a decent od . 
but , overall , a pretty vanilla flavored dirt pedal . 
i was looking for an overdrive or distortion pedal for classic rock , and i finally decided on this one . 
it 's a decent pedal , very solid . 
however , it is very noisy and buzzy when not in use , although all of my distortions are . 
it sounds a little bit thin and hollow to my ears ; it 's ok , but i wouldn ; t purchase it again or really record with it . 
it 's very light and thin sounding . 
i 'm probably going to get a full-tone ocd or something like that instead if you want to use this to power up a tascam dr series digital recorder , i have a less expensive solution for you : if you own a usb wall charger -lrb- like a cell phone charger -rrb- , you can use that to power your device through its usb port . 
that 's a lot cheaper than spending twenty-something dollars on an additional wall wart ! 
behringer perfect pedalboardi can play with my musical band as a real professional with this pedalboard pb1000 from costa rica i recommend it ... thanks behringer if you are using electro-harmonix , red witch , voodoo labs or the larger mxr pedals , they wo n't fit in the styrofoam cutouts . 
you can , though , just take that styrofoam pad out and velcro the effects on to the board.i also have a morley wah and they have big footprints , so they will take up a good initial chunk of room on the board . 
if you have a cry baby , though , everything should fit a little more comfortably . 
right now , i have the morley sitting outside the board due to the number of pedals i own and that four of them are a little outsized -lrb- mxr ten band eq , ehx electric mistress , seymour duncan tweak fuzz -rrb- . 
there is some hum , but it is n't so pronounced that it interferes that much with your sound.so for all that you get with this and the fact that it cuts down almost totally on the need for adapters -lrb- accept a dod malmsteen preamp overdrive -rrb- , this is a great deal . 
of course , the durability is still in question at this point . 
i 've had this for several years . 
it has worked flawlessly . 
it has done a pretty good job with many recordings , especially in the field . 
zoom has now upgraded this unit and has other models on the market that are superior . 
at the time this first came out it was one of the best on the market in its price class . 
this small device has amazing quality . 
the built-in mic records very well compared to those tiny hand-held mono-recorders . 
mic gain controls boost volume but add some noise -lrb- like reviews state -rrb- but when used on low-gain , record quite well . 
audio-in records even better when used with good microphones and a mixer -lrb- i used a behringer u-802 -rrb- for amazingly clear recordings . 
several types of sdhc cards work well and have not found a card that did not work with this device . 
even nimh -lrb- 1.2 v -rrb- batteries can power this , although alkaline -lrb- 1.5 v -rrb- last longer.con : the plastic case is vulnerable to scratches and breakages so treat carefully . 
there are so many reviews of this little jewel , i wo n't bother going into details but it 's everything i could have hoped for and more . 
the sound quality is amazing and it 's very easy to use . 
i 'm using it for so many things including a music player for my truck . 
i take it everywhere and it has never let me down . 
i had to get my own carrying case but for the quality versus price and accessories that are included , i have no complaints . 
a year ago , i wrote a lengthy comparison of theedirol r-09 wave/mp3 recorder , blackand thezoom h4 handy recorder + 2gb accessory kit -lrb- pre-accessory kit -rrb- . 
i wanted a high quality , easy to use recorder , so even though the h4 had all of the features of the edirol and sold for considerably less , i kept the edirol because it was so much easier to use.zoom has responded with the h2 , a scaled down version of the h4 with all of the features of the r-09 and all of the controls right where you need them . 
the h2 even has additional features over the r-09 , but they do n't get in the way . 
for example , there 's a choice of a 90 degree recording pattern , a 120 degree recording pattern , and even a surround sound option . 
samsontech has some nice video demonstrations on its website.one big complaint i 've had with the edirol is the cost of its add-on stand . 
unlike the edirol , the h2 comes with a simple stand . 
in addition , the h2 has a threaded hole so that it can be mounted on a standard digital camera tripod ! 
on a separate note , it 's much easier to replace batteries with the h2 than the edirol.recently , i got together with friends and recorded the same live acoustic music on both the edirol r-09 and the zoom h2 . 
i used adobe audition only to normalize both tracks -lrb- that is , equalize their loudness -rrb- . 
the first time we played them back , i thought i detected a very slight preference for the edirol , with the overall opinion of the group split between the two units . 
the second time we played them back , my preference was for the h2 , with overall opinion continuing to be split . 
we all agreed that the differences were so small as to be negligible if there were any at all.i do prefer the edirol 's control buttons to the h2 's membrane and i 'm not about to sell the edirol , perhaps because i am more familiar with the edirol and do n't want to give it up just yet . 
also , the edirol r-09 is the darling of the moment . 
however , if i owned neither , i could n't justify the huge bump in price of the edirol over the h2 and would opt for the h2 . 
when i went to a music party last weekend and knew i 'd need only one recorder , i grabbed the h2 . 
first , i would be extremely wary of the durability of any piano bench for under $ 50 . 
second , as a professional piano player i have never found a use for a traveling `` bench '' or `` stool . '' 
think about it : you 've got a heavy keyboard to haul plus an amp plus a keyboard stand and maybe a music stand , electric light and music , perhaps even a storage case for the cables , adapters , extra fuses , batteries , tuners , sometimes an extra keyboard or two , or a couple of tone generators with midi cables , or , if you still pack a rhodes , spare tines and a pair of wire cutters -- and you 're going to add a bench -lrb- ! -rrb- 
to your weekly moving equipment caravan?in 90 % of the locations that i 've worked , i 'm able to locate a plain chair without arms -lrb- usually the kitchen crew knows where the house spartan chair can be found -rrb- . 
not only does it reduce by one the paraphernalia , but it helps protect against the body structure problems to which piano players , especially , are prone over the course of thousands of hours of slouching , subjecting finger joints to unhealthy amounts of pressure , too caught up in chords and scales and retrieving half-remembered melodies to register the physical-neurological effects until after the job . 
i 've always envied the lounge act players who can stand while playing -- far better for the entire musculature configuration of the human anatomy -lrb- not to mention prostate -rrb- . 
in fact , if the club or restaurant has a regular piano bench or one of those padded , rising and lowering black steinway cushions , try to replace it with a plain chair without arms . 
especially if you 're doing 4-hour gigs , sometimes two in the same day , you 'll notice the difference short and long term.bottom line , your back needs more pampering than your bottom , which is why you need a seat with a back . 
only concert artists like horowitz and rubenstein could get away with those cushy steinway stools -- 30 minutes to complete the concerto and be done with it -lrb- actually most of the stress was gone upon completion of the cadenza of the first movement -rrb- . 
some of us are n't that lucky -- or gifted -- or smart . 
it is a nice cable for the money seams to be made well . 
looks like it is holding up so far . 
sold , great quality xlr mic . 
it 's pretty hard to mess these up . 
people often build their own , but when they 're this cheap , why go through the trouble ? 
i do n't use it for any heavy use . 
i use it for podcasting purposes . 
have n't had any problems . 
so i ca n't speak to really heavy use of the product . 
i ordered this as a spare and at this time , i have n't used it . 
my microphone came with it 's own cable and this was for a &#34; what if &#34; situation . 
i gave it 4 stars on just expectation . 
works well when jumping or combining your system with xlr 's for noise and clear sound . 
ease in connecting and reconnecting system i 've had this amp for 5 years and it still works and looks great . 
took a while for me to learn all the things that the jam can do since i was new to the world of electric guitars and amps when i received it . 
crank this baby up and it moves air . 
i 've used all the in 's and out 's with no problems . 
my rig consists of an ibanez as73 , schecter devil custom 2008 , line 6 hd500 , and an akg perception 420 thru a line 6 ux2 . 
finally , i only play at home so this gear does n't get banged up from gigging.i agree here > -lrb- as b. russell said : the only downside i can mention is that this amp may not be for the technically challenged . 
there are a lot of features on this amp , but you need to learn how to use them . 
the common features are easy to use , but if you want to dig in and start really taking advantage of the amp , you will need to invest some time into it . 
since i 'm not scared of playing around in menus and reading the manual , this amp fits me well . -rrb- 
i ca n't say anything bad for it because i do n't know much about it other than the fact that it works i got this amp for my 9 year old son along with a squire mini strat . 
verry good combination . 
my son loves them both . 
i bought this gig bag to carry my fender strat around . 
i 'm just starting to learn guitar so i did n't really know much about my options . 
i figured i had a fender guitar so i might as well get a fender gig bag.little did i realize how good this one really is . 
most gig bags do n't come with all these storage pockets . 
there 's plenty of room for a few books , an electronic tuner , string winder , strings , whatever.padding could always be more , but that 's the case with probably any soft-shell bag you buy.all-in-all , i like this bag more and more since i 've discovered that all the other options in the price range are n't nearly as good . 
i really like the deluxe bags by fender . 
plenty of space for stuff , good straps and carry options and enough padding to provide as much protection as a soft bag can . 
really am impressed with this gig bag . 
my beloved jasmine fits perfectly inside , has nice padding , tons of pockets to store stuff , backpack straps and handle for easy carrying , and it looks fab ! 
love the price too . 
ca n't go wrong with this one . 
with some trials using different tubes this pedal can add something that is very tough to get otherwise . 
i run my guitar direct because i do n't like amps or having to cart the things around . 
there are so many shades of tone available that it 's tough to really praise this gadget enough especially considering the low cost . 
i also found using a compresser before it helps . 
i have a pigtronix philosopher 's tone & it made a big differrence . 
i highly reccomend this tube pre-amp & encourage trying out different tubes to get the sound you want . 
i have a blue voodoo all tube amp . 
it 's a dinosaur but has a great tone . 
sadly , i tried revamping it with all new tubes , but though it gave me the drive i needed , it also raised the noise level tremendously . 
this was my last resource before selling an amp i did not want to part with . 
i thought this pedal would do the trick . 
i was right . 
you would think with just one ax7 tube you would get just so much drive , but this puppy gives more than expected . 
behringer used to be known as junk , but no more . 
i teach guitar classes at a community college and spend my days in a room full of twangin ' 'n strummin ' guitars . 
human ears and tuners with external mics , including iphone app tuners , have trouble in such an environment . 
why ? 
the cacophony of competing pitches befuddle both brains and tuning machines . 
so i bring an extra beefyseiko sat800 durable style chromatic tunerand korg cm-100l mic to class for students to use . 
and it works great : clip to the headstock and it isolates their guitar from the din and delivers a clean signal to the seiko.the seiko tuner has hit the deck many times and still looks like new after a couple years . 
unfortunately the cm-100l is not nearly as durable : wires are thin , delicate and prone to breaking . 
if i was the only one using the cm-100l , it would probably last for many years . 
but students are rough and ca n't stop themselves from tightly wrapping the wire around the tuner after they 're finished -lrb- although i ask them not to -rrb- . 
the wire gets stressed at the mic clip and/or plug and shorts out . 
i burn through one or two cm-100l per semester . 
i found a big gob of silicon sealant on stress points helps extend the life of the wire -lrb- electrical tape is useless -rrb- . 
great product : easy to use and makes tuning in a room full of guitars a snap . 
wish they made an industrial strength model with big beefy cables ... there was nothing wrong with my original neckplate , but i was replacing the rest of the hardwear and pick this up just to add just a little something extra . 
it was a direct replacement for the original . 
i bought this to replace another adapter that came with the yamaha keyboard i bought at costco long time ago.the original adapter was bulky and heavy and that 's what caused the wires inside to break.tried to stripped the rubber coating and soldered the wires together , but after short use , the heavy head of the adapter still ripped the wires apart.when it is big and heavy , when you unplug it , sometimes the kids hold the cable instead of the adapter.but the cable can not support the weight thus making it rip.this new design is actually a bit more powerful but only a fraction of the weight and size.it works beautifully the moment i plugged it in.btw , i am using this not on the cp series . 
it actually works for the cheaper keyboards too.my cp33 has this identical adapter which i tested on the other cheap keyboard before i bought it.it 's great.and shipping was fast . 
this ac adapter , in my opinion , should not even qualify to be reviewed since we all know it should be included with the product it is powering . 
that being said , it functions as it was intended to , which is to power a yamaha psre333 61-key portable keyboard . 
it fits perfectly and stays put , all while transmitting electrical current from my home 's 110v outlet into the aforementioned yamaha keyboard . 
thanks for reading.spo really cool looking and are nice picks for the $ $ . 
the eye holes really do make it a better gripping pick than a standard pick . 
great deal from amazon - - thanks !! 
i will definitely buy more of these in the future !! 
my takamine guitar needed a strap button and this button does the job . 
the quality seems to be good and installation went fine.for those of you who are unsure about drilling a hole into the guitar , i would only recommend drilling into cheaper guitars -lrb- unless you know what your doing , of course -rrb- i 've got two other levy 's cotton straps that i picked up at local brick and mortar stores and they 're fantastic ! 
i picked one up on amazon and i was unaware that there was an ` extended length ' version and that it was what i had bought before . 
i suppose it 's just easier for theno big deal though , just an observation worth noting because if you just picked one of these up based on prior purchases -lrb- and you 're a big guy like me and/or you play with the guitar/bass around your knees -rrb- you may not be getting what you thought.in any case , these are very comfortable -lrb- soft edge -rrb- , they stick on you -lrb- as opposed to some other materials which may tend to slide down -rrb- , and they last . 
wonderful and inexpensive strap . 
i use these for all my electrics and have had no problems.well made and easy to adjust . 
not much to say about a guitar strap ... accept i had planned to use it on a simga acoustic without a pin at the neck . 
i ended up using the strap on my strat for the acoustic and this one is on the strat . 
this one does n't come with a wrap or tie for the nut so , it is for use with a guitar with a pin at both sides of the body . 
if you need to secure one end at the headstock , this is not an option . 
it is comfortable though . 
this is a perfect strap for my guitar . 
it 's not rough on my neck and is very adjustable . 
it 's very simple and is perfect for me . 
i 'm very pleased with this purchase . 
i do n't play with a guitar below my waist . 
i am six feet tall . 
while very well made , wide , comfortable and good looking , this sling was far too short and had to be returned . 
i am average build and play a strat . 
i should n't have to feel like this thing just barely fits me . 
i wish it had at least one more inch . 
got the black one . 
bought this to help hold up my heavy sheraton ii and needed something at least 2 inches wide and strong to do it . 
on that level this strap succeeds . 
it is definitely strong enough to keep my guitar from falling off or shifting on my shoulder . 
it also looks very nice.but any positive thoughts i have about it are outweighed by the constant shedding of black dyed leather that continually falls off the strap and onto me , my guitar , my carpets , etc. i need things like guitar straps to be ready to use without causing a shower of little leather bits all over the place ! 
i am not sure how long this will go on but i 've been using it for two weeks now and there is a trail of small black leather wherever i go . 
i have not encountered the dye running yet.honestly if i had it to do over , i would skip this particular strap . 
suede and me are not getting along too well at the moment . 
this is my thrid levy 's strap and it is as good as the rest of them that i have had for a few years . 
i have this strap in black also and hope this one holds up to the rigors of the others . 
i have seen on different sites that the dye is thin but i do n't see a problem with it so far and i use it regularly . 
i have it adjusted to the largest size and wished they were a bit longer , but it is a standard size.i prefer this strap over other cheap leather straps because of the build quality and the fact that they are made in canada and not china or somewhere oversees with cheaper materials . 
for the price , the strap works well and i would buy more levy 's straps if needed . 
price is great . 
works perfect . 
comfortable , and looks sharp . 
not the least bit stiff like some leather products . 
my first experience with levy , and completely satisfied . 
thank you . 
wayne first the goods : sturdy leather construction just cant be beat . 
the color is spot on with the pictures shown.the bads : it 's a bit short , i have it on acoustic guitar that the forward mount is the &#34; shoe lace around the head stock &#34; method , i had to max this strap out to make the span . 
i 'm a bigger guy , so a smaller person should n't have this problem . 
then there 's the whole friction of suede on clothing thing i had n't considered . 
it drags and pulls your shirt really bad , making it a bit of a pain to get the guitar on a positioned where you want it to hang . 
that problem is not specific to this strap , but the material its made out of . 
it 's high quality , but i did n't consider it trying to pull my shirt off . 
if had to do over again , i 'd pass . 
sweet suede . 
the feel of suede is hard to beat . 
this strap fits right , feels good , and looks handsome . 
levy 's is dependable , reliable . 
what more ? 
thank you . 
this is hands down the most comfortable strap i own . 
i am pretty sure it is really a bass strap but i use it on my electric guitars and it is superbly comfortable . 
not cheap but keep looking to see if there is a sale or a demo model . 
worth the wait . 
it works , got it on time , good price phantom power supplies are n't very sexy items , but they 're extremely important if you want to use condensor microphones . 
this nady box is dead quiet and works like a charm . 
totally no-frills , rock solid metal construction and you ca n't hear it at all . 
i have no idea what happened or if anyone else had this problem , but i got literally 8 plug-ins , and not the part where you can plug in an existing cable to make this into a chain . 
it 's like i got an extension cord and male outlets on both ends . 
soooo it 's pretty much useless to me . 
i guess if you get one of those power blocks with 9v outlets on them , i guess you could plug this into it but i really see no point . 
i would 've shipped it back i lost the packaging and just wrote it off as loss . 
i think i payed like $ 8 for it so whatever . 
i would recommend going to an actual music store so you can physically see both the male ends and the female end . 
this is the cheapest and most effective way of saving a lot of money in wasted 9v batteries that will always run out on a gig , rather than when it does n't matter . 
linked to the power supply - which is still cheaper than any of the 9v ones supplied by the manufacturer . 
man ... when i saw these things a light came on in my head ... it was an &#34; uh , duh &#34; moment.no noise , plenty of length and nicely spaced with right-angle plugs for all your standard 9v dc pedals.any complaints about noise with these cables it just a symptom of something wrong within their setup.i had an old wall-wart laying around and put it to good use.check the total amount of amperage draw -lrb- usually 500-1000 milliamps -rrb- to make sure your wall-wart can handle it and daisy-chain away ! 
it 's obviously modeling the boss super chorus but still sounds almost as good just not as clear i am user that likes behringer products . 
i know is plastic but ... com on ! 
it 's just $ 25 . 
what you should know about this pedal ? 
it 's like the boss ch-1 but a plastic version -lrb- a durable one by the way -rrb- . 
well behringer !!! 
, , have to say that the electronics are german mind , , with all that says , , go figure it out for yourself , , other then that !! . . 
plastic so i give 4 stars , cuz of the soft plastic case , and the trouble of changing batteries , , but u can use the charger and u will be well off . . 
sound is really awesome for the money , and it is high standard delay time and sound , , i do n't think u can get the german quality anywhere else for 30 bucks , , i say buy it it is a great delay pedal , , and not only the delay most all behringer effects are sounding great for the money , , can not go wrong . . 
i love this capo . 
let me tell you about my capo journey where i 've used every brand while searching for this one . 
first , i always owned the old dunlop toggle action capo which is just old tech , you know , where it 's just a bundle of synthetic cotton fiber , the kind one used to use before 1980 . 
i had to go back to that when my first planet waves black thermoplastic capo broke . 
do n't buy those if you live in a damp climate like ca . 
each one i bought broke , one broke within a week , during the winter rainy days . 
so i loved those capos , they were perfect , but i was done with the breaking , so i figured i 'd try others instead despite my love for the planet waves design -lrb- i did n't know about the silver aluminum one yet -rrb- . 
well , i hated each other one i tried . 
kyser , if you have had carpal and/or are small handed , you know what i mean , you do n't want a capo that involves squeezing really hard so that your hands are in pain and then you do n't want to play the guitar . 
i really hate the kysers -lrb- i know some folks love to squeeze and use them , that 's fine , different strokes right -rrb- . 
then i tried the schub , you have to be kidding me . 
omg that thing is so ridiculous , it pops off , it wiggles about , it is tricky , i hate it . 
now , i know many folks are schub fans who give me a drive by downrate , i 'm not saying it is n't great for those who love it . 
if you love the schub , you love it unconditionally , and i respect that , all i 'm saying is that design is not for me and many other folks like me . 
there are other models that fail similarly to these 2 , they make you squeeze so hard it does hurt for those like myself with sensitive hands , like the g7 , i did fall in love with it until maybe the 5th squeezing and then you have to hurt your hand by unsqueezing it apart to put it back on . 
awk ~ ward and painful . 
sorry to be such a softie and a crybaby , but if you have carpal , you know what i mean , you want to go easy on the hands and arms , and not brutalize them . 
the other thing i 've always hated about the kysers -lrb- and again it may be that my smaller physique is involved -rrb- is how it gets in the way so chording with a capo is a lot harder . 
that 's just dumb . 
kyser lovers either except that as a challenge or do n't mind it or claim it does n't do that , but you know what i 'm talking about . 
ok , so then because of all the broken planet waves thermoplastic capos , i turned next to dunlop 's turnscrew models . 
i liked them , they are very similar to the pw design , but the screw location is more awkward to use , and turning their screws is a lot harder on the fingers -lrb- got the ripped and pained fingertips to show for it -rrb- . 
so , i turned back in search for a better planet waves model . 
this is it , right here . 
the silver one is excellent , and it 's made of aluminum , not thermoplastic . 
i bought one and it has lasted me almost 3 years now without a single problem . 
by now , in contrast , i would have run through 3 or 4 thermoplastic ones . 
i want to say that if you are performing in a public venue , never use the thermoplastic ones , because my thermoplastic ones dramatically burst and flew across the room , and could easily `` poke someone 's eyes out '' . 
not kidding , do n't use those in public situations . 
back to the excellent aluminum silver pwaves capo . 
i love it , because it does n't break , not at all , and has all of the great thermoplastic model features that make it the best capo ever -lrb- especially for us sensitive folks with carpal or small handed people etc -rrb- . 
the great features are :1 . 
ease of use and easy fitting are perfect , the best of all capos . 
this capo fits so easily . 
simply put it on the fretboard and the location of the screw is perfect -- you never have to move the guitar or your hand more than a couple inches , unlike the other screwtops or all other capos , there 's no need for any moving around , adjusting the guitar , falling down due to balance issues and then chasing a falling guitar , sheesh none of that nonsense . 
you put it on and they 've engineered it brilliantly so you can easily get it on , move it from fret to fret , put it where you want , and screw it in with great ease ! 
wow , best ever in this category . 
ease of use is tops , ever ! 
2 . 
it will never hurt you , it only helps . 
it weighs nothing , is easy to carry , you can slip it onto the peg area , it just is so light . 
i still ca n't believe how light it feels .3 . 
it does what it 's supposed to , that other capos do n't do . 
no issues with being in tune , just screw it in to the level of tightness you desire , no wrestling around like some capos do . 
the screw is in the most easy location , and the screw itself is nicely made so it does n't hurt your fingers at all when you screw and unscrew , it 's a breeze . 
no problems with the size , it 's so small , it does n't get in your way on the fretboard . 
you wo n't have to do hand yoga in order to play capo 'd songs , it is flat -lrb- i know , what a concept ! -rrb- . 
a capo should always be flat and out of your way so you can play chords , not pretzeled twister instead of chords . 
now , i play capo 'd songs all the time because of this capo , and it is so much fun musically , a whole new magical experience . 
the truth i 've found is that good equipment matters in music making -lrb- i never played acoustic guitar as well or as much until i got my first applause guitar with great action . 
i have a yamaha i love now -lrb- since the applause necks break -rrb- , but both guitars taught me that you have to have good equipment that 's easy to use -lrb- in the case of guitars , great action is imperative . 
in the case of capos , ease of use and no pain produced is imperative , and it opens up the world of capo use , the magic of the mathematics of music theory . -rrb- 
if you love the other brands , do n't diss me , i know it 's perfect for you , and i 'm happy for you that it works perfectly for you , because when you have the best one for you , you will shine with your music and i will enjoy listening to you play . 
but those of you who have sensitive or small hands or have carpal know what i 'm talking about , you wo n't settle for the torture of kysers and schubs , got ta be kidding me . 
i bought every capo imaginable -lrb- need to have a garage sale to get rid of the pile -rrb- but ended up that i was using the old toggle type again instead until i found the aluminum silver planet waves capo . 
planet waves has made the perfect capo now , no more issues , just easy fun playing capo 'd songs . 
again , only buy the silver model , because when/if you get silver , you are guaranteed to get aluminum , not thermoplastic . 
i bought this cable in an emergency situation - one where i was on the road , needed a great cable , and did n't have access to roll my own using , what would 've been , essentially the same parts . 
i exclusively use canare and mogami in the studio , and in critical places of my live setup . 
the cable itself is top shelf , quiet , and will provide years of use if you treat it even with modest respect . 
as an instrument cable , this could possibly be a little short if you move around a bunch , making it worth it to go for the 18 ' cable as a bass or guitar player if you do n't like being tied down . 
i used this as part of a keyboard rig , where it was perfect on all levels - quality reproduction of sound across the entire spectrum -lrb- the highs were crystal , the bass clear -rrb- , connection is solid -lrb- i am not a gold fanatic , but these are excellent -rrb- , great warranty , and a reputation that holds value . 
-lrb- these are real deal pro cables , as opposed to some cables priced similarly that have a monster price , but not necessarily a superior build or sound , which is why i did n't walk into guitar center and buy a pair of monster 1000 's and waited for these to be delivered overnight instead , , , -rrb- ... but it works fine for me.i used to connect a orange micro terror head amporange amplifiers micro terror mt20 20w hybrid guitar amp head -lrb- standard -rrb- to a cabinet ppc108orange ppc108 1x8 '' speaker cabinet without going over the fiscal cliff these cables worked very well in my 7-pedal guitar affect lineup.no noticeable hiss , hum or buzzing . 
clean & quiet.good buy for the price . 
i use this cable to patch my effects pedals together and it does what it needs to do . 
the right angle ends make it easy to connect your pedals and keep them close together . 
this is unique piece that slips into just about any tube on a mixer rack or piano scissor stand . 
the square nut design is very tight when tightening in the tube as if there are a rough cut on the threading . 
the mic end of the mount works pretty good . 
overall the only problems i found is that the up tube could be 1 ' to 1 1/2 ' taller and the threads could be buffed out at the manufacturer . 
nice amp for the money but could n't push a single peavey sp218 sub , so i moved this amp to push a pair of dual 15 's , still had trouble getting the range that i needed , so i have this amp now as a back up and will probally use it for powering a single ev18 sub rated at 500 watts , it should handle it nicely bridged , i will keep you posted . 
lifesaver . 
i bought this and a planet wave 's o-port -lrb- which advertises that it can help reduce feedback as well -rrb- i use this at every show where i have to plug-in . 
this is a must for anyone who plugs in and does n't want to worry about feedback . 
it works well , i use it for my oscar schmidt . 
i do n't use it for feedback , i use it to protect it from the dust . 
it fits tight but it 's fine ! 
fits great and helps to eliminate feedback . 
i could see some having problems with the size of their sound holes and it can be a tight fit but it definitely works . 
i borrowed a friends mxr to try and liked the added sounds it gave me . 
it filled a hole that was missing . 
since 80 % of my board is behringer pedals i looked at behringer first and was delighted when i found the ph9 classic 90 . 
side by side with the mxr , there was n't a hole lot of difference and with the behringer 's added swirl switch , gives you a few more options . 
it also is made of metal for all of you that constantly criticize behringer for their use of plastic in there other pedals . 
-lrb- i 've read a ton of reviews and still have n't heard of one breaking because of the plastic -rrb- as far as value to money spent , this pedal is again at the top of the list . 
oh ! 
it also sounds great !!!!! these have it all . 
sound great , play great , feel great , tune great . 
i am now dedicated to these strings . 
it takes about 4 or 5 days before the strings are fully stretched and holding onto its tuning . 
once it does , it 's beautiful music after that . 
i 've bought these d'addario strings a few times because they are a great deal . 
they sound nice and bright , and they last a good while . 
they are easy on the fingers . 
the best part is that you save money by buying them in a 3-pack . 
i 've used these on the reg for a year . 
obviously there are better sounding monitors out there , but these are really great for what you pay for imo.i 'd recommend these to someone trying to save some money.updatetwo years in with continued regular use . 
they sound just as good as they did a year ago . 
on the plus side , these monitors look and feel amazing . 
they are coated in some kind of silky rubberized stuff and they are heavy and look neat.they do n't sound horrible . 
i mean , they are not computer speakers or anything . 
the sound is very forward , i would say harsh . 
that 's not uncommon among studio monitors . 
there is definitely a lot of clarity here . 
not a ton of bass , but that 's pretty much understood from monitors with woofers of this size . 
there 's a few schools of thought on studio monitors . 
some people think they are basically for bringing out the warts in your music , others think they should sound more like a normal speaker . 
these will be more pleasing to people interested in the first . 
i definitely sounds like the music is right in your face when you are listening to this . 
any flaws would be quite noticeable.i previously used krk rp8 's so i can compare these to them . 
granted , they are larger and more expensive , although they are also budget monitors . 
i liked them better than these . 
they were clear but also sounded nicer and , of course , had much more bass.i was going to put a woofer on these and burn them in ... see if i could improve the situation ... but one of the speakers starts to buzz about 5 minutes after it 's turned on . 
the buzz increases in volume over time . 
i tried moving them to a different location , turning the volume down , even disconnecting the audio feed -lrb- so they were only plugged into the power -rrb- . 
nothing stopped the buzz . 
if they are warmed up and you turn them off and then on again , the buzz starts up in more like 10 or 20 seconds . 
so i sent them back . 
i was n't really impressed with the sound and i 'm definitely not satisfied with the quality control , so i 'm going to try some larger and more expensive monitors instead . 
maybe behringer 3031a 's or something . 
i think it 's worth an extra 200 dollars or so to get a full-sized monitor . 
this pick is def not one i 'd use to solo with , but its def a good pick for slower , more acoustic oriented guitar-work . 
whenever i play a song consisting solely of chords , i break this guy out . 
picks with no texture or friction enhancement are old technology . 
these pick are cutting edge . 
none better . 
possibility created by the multi-flex feature and the grip . 
awesome . 
these make me a better player . 
i used to have trouble holding on to picks . 
problem solved . 
stress gone . 
for about 30 yrs . 
have been playing finger style only - usually with alternating bass , and never really used a pick so this seemed like a good first choice.for the song i was performing , chords were bm , e , f# m , and g -lrb- 1st & 3rd position -rrb- and i needed to back up the singer so it was really just strumming with a tiny bit of playing just the first two strings as an intro.i found a very old and very thin peavey pick unintentionally picking up what looked like the blue dava in the bottom of my guitar case and it worked perfectly so i then ordered the fender abalone thin picks and find they make playing chords quite easy.fender 351 premium celluloid guitar picks , 12 pack , abalone , thinmy ancient peavey broke in half not long after , and i continued using the stub turned sideways while waiting for the new fender picks to arrive because i liked the extra flex -rrb- seems like more advanced players like at least a medium to better pick individual strings , but since i never liked using a pick at all , the fender thin works best for me and i 'm enjoying learning to use it on songs like eric clapton 's interpretation of bessie smith 's `` nobody knows you ... `` i 'll try the dava picks again later if i feel the need . 
i play simon and garfunkel 's version of scarborough fair which is exclusively finger picking and george harrison 's `` here comes the sun '' - where he uses a pick , but it is still easier for me to pick out the individual notes fingerstyle.this is all on an acoustic 6 string steel guitar , using d'addario ej16 phosphor bronze light strings.bristol by blueridge bd-16 dreadnaught acoustic guitar -lrb- natural -rrb- d'addario ej16 phosphor bronze acoustic guitar strings , lightfor the rank beginner who has never picked up a pick before , the fender thin makes it easier to strum because the pick flexes so it 's not as essential to turn your wrist as much to get the pick to move smoothly over the strings.the grip is better on the dava , but they are n't going to flex as much . 
undoubtedly better for more accomplished players . 
most advise i 've seen says try 'em all and decide for yourself . 
i was just amazed and delighted how much easier the fender thin made it for me to get started . 
i have always had trouble holding onto picks . 
my fingers just could n't do it for extended play . 
nothing worse than shaking your pick out of the body ! 
lol . 
i wish i would have thought of these . 
they were just what i needed . 
they work great . 
i really like using this pick with my acoustic nylon string guitar . 
the rubber makes it easy to hold onto and i feel it obtains good sound on the guitar as well . 
dava 6024 grip tipitem is as advertised . 
this is my first attempt at playing the mandolin for which i selected this product . 
they work just fine for a starter . 
i may learn different as time goes along , assuming that you can teach an old dog new tricks as the saying goes . 
this tuner is awesome and accurate , very noticeable and what else can i say , for the price , best deal ever . 
get it ! 
ps i use it for my base though , satisfied . 
thanks korg !!! 
i use to tune with an antique korg ... i saw these baby on the road with maroon5 's james ... just make sure your guitar intonation is perfect . 
i bought this tuner over the tc electronic poly tune and i am very happy with my purchase . 
very simple to use , great visibility and it does not color the signal when not engaged . 
it also has the ability to daisy chain from it into other pedals but currently i have no such need . 
i highly recommend . 
behringer us600 ultra harmonist/shifter pedal is pretty good.you need a little time to learn , then it will rock you.just try it . 
this is an affordable copy of the boss harmonist pedal . 
i bought this mainly for the harmonist and polyphonic pitch shift feature . 
but was surprised by how much fun the trem bar and flutter mode was to play with.anyway on the third day the tracking on the pedal suddenly started to have about a one second delay . 
and on fourth day in addition to the tracking problem , hitting certain notes caused a low pitch fluttering noise . 
also the pedal just started oscillating a few times . 
i would have given the behringer us600 five stars if it kept working , it tracked nice and did n't tone suck too bad . 
an old school delay that works very well . 
simple to use . 
adjustments for intensity and length . 
uses 9v batt or power adaptor . 
reasonably priced . 
i have a lot of pedals ... . 
including many delays and echos ... the mxr is just little more organic and warm in tone and response then my aqua puss , eh delux memory boy , ibanez , boss , and lets not even get into the behringer stuff ... : -rrb- i like the chorus-like mod button . 
very lush and sweet to listen too . 
not as feature rich as some of my other delays , but a tad more appealing to the ear then the others to me . 
simple to use , compact and well built . 
i like using this clean ... but even it 's ability to take some distortion is pretty good.this is simliar to my favorite echo -lrb- the morely ecv from the 70 's -rrb- in that is has that real warm surrounding sound to it . 
lush is the right word.hope this helps . 
while i 've never been a big delay guy , i 've always felt my pedal board was missing this particular affect . 
i 'm definitely not a fan of digital delay , so i did a lot of r&d ; on analog delays in hopes to find the right one for me.there are basically three options out there for delays under $ 200 : mxr carbon copy , ehx memory boy , and malekko ekko 616 . 
i realize that there are other pedals out there , but according to my research these are the best three for the price.the memory boy seemed good but my concern was it can do a lot of exaggerated modulation , something i was not interesting in . 
crazy effects are an ehx trademark so if you 're looking for that sort of thing the memory boy might be up your alley . 
i read nothing but good things about the malekko ekko and tossed back and forth between that and the carbon copy for a while and ultimately went with the carbon copy because i was able to find the most first-hand reviews of it.i do n't regret my decision , this pedal sounds great . 
the repeats are long and do not sound artificial . 
some people complain the repeats are too dark but i do n't think those people understand the difference between analog and digital delay . 
if you 're looking to recreate the edge sound , analog delay is not for you.i 'm able to create all types of sounds from this pedal from just thickening up a rhythm track , to slapstick , to dreamy repeats on solos . 
i love it . 
sometimes i just leave the pedal on with the mix knob dialed down for subtle ambience in my tone.one minor criticism is that the modulation affect is subtile , at least out-of-the-box . 
there are internal trimpots to make the affect more pronounced but i have yet to mess with them . 
i would rather have had the controls be knobs on the pedal itself . 
this inexpensive pedal kicks ass , provides everything from subtle spring reverb to vast cathedral-like reverb . 
the ` space ' setting is unique in that it adds an interesting modulated overtone a couple octaves above the sounded note , providing a strange harmony . 
some people pick on behreinger because they 're stuff is -lrb- still -rrb- cheap . 
i admit that two of their pedals -lrb- of the 10 that i have bought -rrb- underwhelmed me . 
this one is a keeper ! 
works well , has many options of reverb and tweaks on all the options . 
i would recommend this pedal for an inexpensive reverb . 
up date from february 08 2011 wow look at all of them that did not find my review helpful i should have up dated much sooner , not that i care because i tell the truth and do good to please myself not a bunch of fools . 
the first time i turned it on it was exactly the sound i was looking for shimmer and space verb.okay i am apologizing for ordering the last one i guess i take the easiest way of ordering but if it makes you feel better it put me farther in financial problems but if you look on some search there are some still left . 
behringer needs to look at what the customers is buying and make more of them . 
if your buying this reverb machine then you must be wanting it for its ducking also called shimmer and space verb if not then there are cheaper reverbs as danelectro as fab echo which is a nice sounding older type slap reverbs sound and there is the more expensive line 6 verbzilla , and someone wrote me and said boss has or did have this affect there are internet videos showing this affect . 
my digitech gsp 2101 quit working right it has ducking shimmer which digitech calls string swell which is a violin type sound and they call space verb giga verb and i made the mistake of buying the behringer slow motion 200 thinking string or volume swell was shimmer then if found what i was looking for on internet video i hope . 
i had already wrote some songs using my digitech gsp 2101 and started having dreams about having this sound affect again and just had to have it.how well this behringer rv600 performs and sounds i have not received it yet to know but if possible i will do an up date but i have a behringer ep2500 power amplifier that still works good which i even used as part of a rife , doug coil machine but the ep4000 would be better for that use also the fan runs all the time . 
bought verbzilla , digitech rv-7 , and the verbzilla 's ripoff : behringer rv600.the types of reverb i get from verbzilla is very insignificant to be used for my synths . . 
so for that many kind of modes , barely useful . 
and i hate the fact that line 6 always used the mix knob instead of the separated level and reverb/fx level , cos you have to sacrifice your volume to get an extreme reverb , which is sucks.then i tried the digitech rv-7 . 
first thought was . . 
wow , what a construction it 's got there . 
fancy knobs , and additional stuffs like thick rubberized knobs cover , velcro , glow in the dark sticker . 
and the fact that it has the lexicon soul in it . 
i love this one better than the verbzilla , cos you do n't have to sacrifice the volume to get a heavy reverb . . 
but the problem was . . 
there 's no heavy reverb there . 
i could n't get a ridiculous amount of reverb out of this pedal . 
but i love the gated reverb feature among all modes . 
every other modes are just nothing special really . 
it was just a light reverb i get.aaaand finally i tried this blue thick plastic pedal . . 
skeptical at first , and i can see that it has also the mix knob like verbzilla has i was a little disappointed . 
but i really can sense my juno 60 and my moog sings differently on each modes with this one . 
and i 'm very happy that the mix and the decay could go ridiculous without having volume loss as much as the verbzilla does . 
it could be painful for guitar players , cos they can not boost up your guitar volume without anything else if it 's already full , but i could always gain the volume of my synth to balance it with the mix knob -lrb- since i never put the volume knob on the synth at full -rrb- . 
i could sense the difference of each modes with this pedal and it 's hell loads of them.let me tell you the ugly truth about those 3 pedals that i 've tried . . 
they are all battery hogs ! 
it was ridiculous . . 
i mean bad bad ridiculous that it was only lasted about 5-10 mins of nonstop use of battery before it 's dried up . 
so i suggest you to use the power adapter . 
and the only thing i hate about rv600 is the way that we have to put back the battery cover to it 's place cos we have to put the spring back to it 's track while closing it slowly , and that black plastic latch on the side does n't feel it could last longi do n't care what ppl said about this pedal , but it 's been very useful for me and my synthesizers , we do n't need to get an expensive gears as long as we can make great sounds . 
it 's all comes back to our ability to make good music . 
good luck guys ! 
i 've had this for 4 days and i 'm so glad i bought it . 
its basically a top end 2 second delay with whistles and bells you would n't even think they would be on there . 
i have had alot of delay pedals and this thing is limitless accept for the 2 second loop capabilities . 
i like this bag , though it is slightly different from the bag that is pictured . 
it 's a bit too big for my tenor uke , it 's most probably made for a baritone uke.all in all a good value for the money ! 
the construction , fabric , color and padding are all a-1 . 
this is a super bag ! 
my precious uku will always be protected and look good too . 
i bought this under the impression that it was a soprano gig bag . 
i know it says tenor -lrb- now that i look at it -rrb- but since i put soprano gig bag into the amazon search i figured i would be getting only soprano bags ... anyway it does n't seem much more then a normal gig bag . 
yes it has the pocket for your extra strings and what not . 
not sure how well it holds a tenor since i do n't have one . 
mine is black not the almost purple the image shows ... i have owned many delay pedals in the past several decades.i like this one the best ... especially for the price range.boss dd-7 beats the pants off the line 6 echo park delay . 
the echo park delay causes a little noise/interference when not used , being caused by the little led light flashing ... you can hear it buzz each time it flashes through the amp . 
the boss dd-7 was perfectly clean and did not altar the tone.many great features including an on-the-fly sampler/looper . 
the ability to control it with an external pedal/switch . 
easy to set and adjust while playing live and on-the-fly . 
matches perfectly with other boss pedals.standard `` built like a tank '' boss construction is renowned for.it also beats the other boss delay pedals available for quality , sound and features.many options , settings and configuration choices makes this pedal versatile.i bought this for quality , ease of use and straightforward operation while playing live.it also `` self-oscillates & freaks out '' quite well . 
-lrb- if you 're into that sort of thing ! -rrb- 
make sure you read the instruction and settings operation manual . 
there are `` new '' operations and ways to `` set '' this pedal up to perform certain functions . 
this is the best delay i have tried thus far . 
extremely versatile and , as is typical with all boss pedals ; absolutely sturdy ! 
a delay is such a necessary addition to one 's personal effects , and i really can not emphasize enough just how perfectly this works in pretty much any style of music ! 
well worth the price !! 
item was shipped in a timely manner and with secured packaging . 
works great , just what i needed to have to walk all over the room . 
now i sit in my chair i 've read the revues and some do n't do them justice . 
these fit very well , do the job they 're supposed to do and if you know you have a hardwood guitar , just use a cordless drill to attach them , make sure you place the clutch at a low level in order not to strip the wood and have a secure fit . 
this is a very quite tube and has all the gain you 'd expect from a great 12ax7 tube . 
if your looking to push a power tube into distortion this little bugger will definately do the trick . 
this thing does n't tip over easily , which is perfect for my teen son who is n't all that easy on his equipment . 
adjusts easily enough , and the price is perfect . 
the base is heavy and you screw the pole to it once you do this they should not be undone or you may damage the tread this makes it incoveniente to carry for mobile dj 's . 
for the price and quality i would buy two other ones . 
the base for this thing is a monster ! 
the thing works great , and because of the very strong load the base provides - not the easiest thing to accidentally knock over . 
do n't buy this chinese piece of crap if you really need a three guitar stand . 
it is barely workable for two.it is easy to set up , but the way the neck brackets are arranged you are only going to get two guitars comfortably on it and even then guitars can still slip off the stand even when you tighten the little rubber thingies on top to hold the neck in place . 
and you absolutely have to keep that tight or your guitar will at some point turn sideways and fall to the floor/ground . 
the best thing these stands are built for are v type guitars such as my jackson rhoads as long as you can put them back to back . 
for les paul and strat type axes , their rounded lower bout curvatures make them prone to slipping on the narrow , stick like feet of the stand , especially when they are new . 
you ca n't tilt the feet up to try to lend more stability to the way the guitars hang because the feet wo n't support enough weight to make that possible . 
so this thing utterly fails in its designation as a three guitar stand . 
if you just got ta buy something from on stage , get the double hang because there is more separation between instruments and so it ends up being better balanced . 
but really , you should just pass entirely on either the triple hang or the double hang.this is definitely a case of one gets what one pays for . 
great deal for the price and very sturdily made . 
easy to assemble and feels very solid . 
way cheaper than i saw in guitar center . 
im very pleased with this stand . 
i bought two . 
i use this stand for a smaller 50 watt fender amp . 
i do n't think i would recommend it for larger amplifiers , especially since it sits a little high , but for my amp , it 's perfect . 
nevertheless , i also do n't really plan on packing it up or moving the stand around much , so i ca n't imagine it being ideal for portability . 
if you have a music studio and are doing more recording and/or rehearsing than playing gigs , this is a really nice stand . 
needed a stand to lift my pa mixer off the floor for safety and ease of use . 
for $ 20 , this is a sturdy little unit and collapses nicely for transportation . 
but it is a definite tipping risk if used at anything higher than the lowest height setting.i took the lead from reviewer w. jones and `` removed the upper brackets and inserted them with the longest bars horizontal instead of vertical , and although my amp was more stable , i still did n't feel it was stable enough to set it on the highest setting . '' 
i am using at the lowest height and it is stable , but i highly recommend a heavy sandbag on the back if any other height setting is used.i give four stars for great value at $ 20 , will suit my needs very well . 
it 's perfect for what it does and that is to hold your amp and tilt it a bit toward the ceiling . 
great price , great stand . 
what more do i need to say ??? i gig a lot and since i am a grey haired musician i need to sit when it will be over an hour of playing . 
this seat works great for me and folds up and can be disassembled with very little fuss . 
the back rest support is nice , too . 
for the price its well constructed and perfect for the solo musician doing gigs all over the country . 
it arrived in a small package with 3 main pieces in it -lrb- the base , the bottom fork and the top fork -rrb- and it did n't take much assembly to put it together . 
it does a great job holding the guitar upright and makes it look a lot nicer as well . 
i will probably buy a couple more of these.the only downside i can see so far is that the foam padding is rather thin . 
i hope this does n't eventually have a hole wear through it , but over time i could see it happening . 
i suppose by that time i could find some replacement foam and fix it myself though . 
is a good stand . 
relatively small but is a secure . 
the locking top is a good feature as well . 
id recommend this over the larger tubular type . 
this is a very well-built stand . 
looks good too . 
it does its job well and you can definitely be sure that it will last quite long . 
highly recommended . 
cheers ! 
serves the purpose.i needed a stand at home and this does just fine.i liked the price . 
i would prefer the cradle not to swivel , but i am happy . 
it 's nice for my son to be able to stand his five string bass up in his room on display , while still having it be kept safe . 
it helps him remember to practice when he sees it . 
i was a bit hesitant to buy a guitar stand for only 10 bucks but glad i did.this stand is very sturdy , well made & durable.foam padded everywhere guitar touches !! 
can be folded for easy transport !! 
rubber strap on neck rest ensures guitar will stay put if bumped hard !! 
pleasently surprised at the quality of this stand !! 
highly recommended , very happy with purchase !! 
joe works great as a stand for the elec.guitar . 
work good in corners . 
and i like it for starting out learning . 
i was amazed how much better this stand was then the one i had just bought at guitar center for the same price . 
i thought they would be the same but they were not . 
this stand is built much better . 
i actually own an even dozen of these . 
i 've never had any issues with them marring the finish on my acoustic guitars . 
they work great & you ca n't beat the price . 
i think i paid around $ 4.95 for most of the ones i purchased . 
although these are great & i will continue to use them as needed -lrb- e.g. , when playing -rrb- , i just replaced these today with swing string wall hangers . 
i freed-up so much of my floor space by moving 12 guitars to the wall that i was actually excited about all the free space !!! 
this is a great product . 
very light , very sturdy and at a low price . 
well worth the investment . 
does its job just fine . 
simple and kind of cheap looking and its hard to balance if you have it on a rug -lrb- and not even a thick rug ... i have a thin rug and it still is unbalanced , but hey , its not really meant for rugs so i ca n't complain -rrb- this does n't look very robust , i expect it will work well in my home studio but if my kids get with in 6ft of it ; consider it broken . 
the swivle hinge is secure and will hold it 's position as well as the clamp but they could not have been made any more marginally weak.the backing board mine came with is about 2/3 the size of a full sheet of paper , make what you will of that ... and mine is actually secured to the clamp with dual side adhesive so separating them would be a chore and a risk.overall , a reasonable value and i 'm glad i bought it . 
it is what it is . 
works . 
works as expected and should last a really really long time . 
glad i bought it . 
these a cheaply made with corrugated plastic , however they are surprisingly durable . 
these are not 8.5 x11 -lrb- paper size -rrb- . 
they are about half-sheet size . 
could use a longer cable but it does work as it was suggested , and would purchase again if i needed to . 
i have had a few converters purchased at electronics stores over the years and none seem to stand up to the vigorous use placed on them by the road . 
i have not had this long enough to know if it will , but so far so good ... i 'm only running two pedals , so i 'm not sure how far you can push this , but it 's working fine for my setup . 
i needed a 9-volt adapter to use with an danelectro n10b honey tone mini amp . 
this was recommended and i am happy with the product . 
five stars because it works on my digitech gnx guitar processor which requires 9 volts and about 75 milli-amps . 
this has an output of 300 milli-amps . 
for electronics the voltage has to be correct . 
but an appliance will only draw as many amps -lrb- current -rrb- as it needs . 
so this adapter is coasting when used with the guitar processor and can be used with other devices that draw up to the 300 mamps . 
just be sure your -lrb- 9v -rrb- device does n't require more than the 300 ma this can deliver . 
but it 's a power adapter , i can not be in love with a power adapter . 
ok reviewing something 's i just do n't see the need . 
ok that being said , i searched for lowest costing 9v adaptor that met or exceeded the am required to run my pedals ... this came up first and is imo all that one would need to run a pedal or other guitar add ons . 
i dont know what else to say ... . 
the cord is n't very long but not overly short either , i have another brand adapter and it is about the same length and size etc. ok for now that 's all i got , i may edit later on down the line . 
earnie ball 's guitar strap locks are great . 
in my opinion , the best there way over other brands like dunlop , schaller and many others . 
i have them installed on my les paul axcess and my jackson dinky and they are very secure both when rehearsing and gigging . 
you can definetely trust them to do their job . 
they also look great . 
highly recommended . 
my les paul is heavy . . 
the strap would constantly fall off . 
so i decided to get a set of strap locks . 
these installed in minutes , and really dont change the look of the guitar at all . 
you will need a nut driver to screw the lock to your strap . 
if you dont have locks on all your guitars , you cant interchange your straps easily any more , so i recommend getting them for all your guitars . 
the other added benefit i found is that on my hollow body the strap was actually scratching the back . 
with these locks the strap sits away from the guitar , so it fixes that problem as well . 
when i buy a new guitar , i get new locks . 
are there better locks out there ? 
i 'm not sure , but im committed now as i wanted the same locks on all my guitars . . 
has never failed me yet . 
i had looked around for strap locks for my dean dime razorback , and was not happy to see that most locking mechanisms were designed with a button on top to release them . 
my guitar straps attach on the rear and underside of the guitar which would be easy to accidentally press when the guitar hits my waist causing unknown horrible damage.then i saw these and knew they were perfect for my situation . 
i installed them last night and could not be happier . 
they are very solid and the lock is ` positive ' so you can feel the click when it is set . 
i am sure they will work well if your guitar straps mount in the traditional spots as well . 
this is a great product at a good price.note : if you are installing on a dean razorback or ml , the stock front strap mount screw goes through the plate , body into the neck ... do not use this to mount , or pull the old strap mount off and return the screw ... it is too long and will likely split your neck . 
just drill a hole right next to it and install the locking mount right next to it -lrb- it can touch it even and still function properly -rrb- . 
enjoy ! 
i really am happy that my guitar is much more secure now and do n't worry that i will hurt my favorite guitar . 
this mighty bright is great !!!! it clips to my music stand , has battery power or ac adapter -lrb- included -rrb- and lights up the entire music stand with very little glare . 
if you need a light for reading music or for just reading , this is it ... . 
i love this light . 
it runs on electric so no need for batteries . 
the goosenecks are metal and well made and the led lights have switches that can turn on single or double leds on each side . 
it will clip on anything you want to hold it . 
it 's simple , well made and works great . 
i am a musician who needed budget home studio equipment . 
paired up with a nice pop filter , this mic is able to produce some amazing vocal recordings . 
you 'd be surprised to find out how many famous youtube musicians or podcast creators use this mic . 
it took me some time to get the hang of miking amps , positions and vocal distance , but i am truly getting more than my money 's worth for what it 's putting out . 
check out some demos of quality on youtube if you need further convincing . 
i am very glad i made this purchase.i 've owned this mic for 2 years if you 're curious about durability . 
i use this to record vocals and acoustic guitar on my imac . 
the simplicity of this mic is very nice . 
the sound quality is also very decent . 
i have n't ever used one of those ` professional ' quality ones but this has not disappointed me so far . 
the only complaint i have is that there is no ` on/off ' switch . 
the only way to turn it off is to unplug it . 
other than that i totally recommend this microphone ! 
perfect chain for most rock sounds.get the 28 strand for a thicker snap.i might try out the 28strand next year . 
i 'm pretty happy with this one right now.the place i live in has corrosive air though its not messed these chains . 
i ordered this after i saw one on a squier bass at a local shop . 
the plate looks great on my mim fender telecaster and it is thicker and nicer than the fender ` f ' plate i see on other guitars . 
i used the screws and it was an easy install . 
other reviewers have posted about the finish and thickness of the plate . 
the plate has five screw holes , but does n't look bad using 4 . 
this is just a visual mod for me mainly to get rid of the crappy cheap plate which is used on my mim telecaster . 
i was surprised at the sound that this amp produces . 
the build quality is top notch . 
tuner is right on , overdrive seems fine . 
i 'm not an overdrive player.cons : so far none and i do n't expect any . 
if you 're anything like me , then i know what you 're thinking : digitech = digital , fake-sounding junk . 
not anymore . 
the digitech hardwire cm-2 finishes what digitech began with the bad monkey , which is a great overdrive pedal in its own right . 
but the cm-2 offers tone quality that compares to the best on the market -lrb- and as a pedal maniac , i 've owned wayyyy too many overdrive and distortion pedals , so in all humility , i know what i 'm talking about -rrb- and flexibility that is rivaled by none in the market for anything close to the price.what makes the cm-2 so great is that , like several other reviews have mentioned , it 's not just another tube-screamer clone . 
there is no distinct mid-range hump and slightly rolled off bass that tubescreamers -lrb- particularly the ts-9 -rrb- are known to have . 
there is a lot of range to all the knobs ; the level can add some serious boost , bass and treble knobs allow you to significantly change your tone if that 's what you 're after , or you can dial it to be more -lrb- but never completely -rrb- transparent . 
also , the cm-2 has more gain on tap than most overdrive pedals ; you can go from basically a clean boost to adding a surprising amount of saturation to your tone . 
lastly , the classic vs. modified switch gives you the option of adding some gain and bass by switching from classic to modified.i 've tested the cm-2 as both an overdrive to a clean channel fender hotrod deville , and as a front-end boost to my bugera 1990 -lrb- basically a marshall jcm 900 -rrb- . 
the cm-2 sounds great in both applications . 
over the clean channel of the fender , it sounds very full and smooth . 
even turned all the way up , the overdrive never sounded very `` grainy '' or fuzzy ; it maintained warmed , organic , and tube-like . 
`` boutique-esque '' is how i would characterize it . 
great for blues playing , and i 'm sure that playing with the tone knobs you could dial in some good country tones as well.however , i use it more as a front-end boost to my already-overdriven bugera amp . 
in front of the lead channel , cm-2 serves to take my tone from hard-rock crunch territory to a more metal tone , with chunky bass and roaring highs that make palm-muted riffs sound as at home as if they were coming through a peavey 6505 . 
as a conclusion , i 'm really pleased with the quality of the digitech cm-2 . 
both the sound and build quality are top-notch , and for a price similar to or less than most quality overdrive pedals on the market , i highly recommend checking out the cm-2 . 
the cm-2 is magnificent : -lsb- 1 -rsb- it produces beautiful overdrive -lrb- one that does n't destroy your guitar 's tone -rrb- . 
-lsb- 2 -rsb- it has independent `` high '' and `` low '' tone controls , and these controls are extremely sensitive to even minor changes -- thus allowing for great versatility in tone-manipulation . 
-lsb- 3 -rsb- it features a switch that allows you to pick between `` classic '' overdrive and an extra blast of distortion -lrb- `` modified '' -rrb- . 
-lsb- 4 -rsb- the case is made of metal . 
-lsb- 5 -rsb- it comes with a cover for the knobs so that you can avoid altering your settings when depressing the pedal . 
this pedal will not give you `` metal '' distortion ; for that consider digitech 's tl-2 . 
instead , it produces a warm , old-time overdriven tone . 
i love this thing ! 
this cup holder clamps on easily and really holds your drink so you dont have to worry about it . 
the insert part is made out of thick material so it will smash down when you pack it up . 
you dont really notice the name on both sides at gigs , just a cold beer in front of you thats always in the same place ! 
i love it . 
this is a very useful and quite educational musician 's piece . 
i especially like the way it is presented and how easy it is to use . 
it easily helps remember all possible scales and shows many tricks for your musical compositions . 
highly recommended . 
cheers ! 
this educational device is truly an asset to all musicians , especially guitar players . 
because it gives complete scales , and notations at a moments glance i find it extremely helpful when my hands are busy , but my mind is wandering . 
i am confused by this hellish portal of confusion . 
looking at it makes me ill - i feel like it 's laughing at me , with its indecipherable scribbles . 
over the years , i 've literally owned dozens of electronic tuners ... generally five or six at a time in various locations ... ranging from a $ 12 musiciansfriend promotional item to a $ 200 rack mount . 
most have been in the $ 30 range from sabine , yamaha , korg , and seiko . 
the seiko sat800e is my all time favorite because , like mama bear in the fairy tale , it affordably splits the difference between `` too small '' and `` too big '' . 
it stays put on the floor when i run it inline between my guitar/bass/uke and my amp and its lcd display is large enough to be legible when i 'm standing . 
at the same time , it neatly fits in my ukulele case . 
beyond that , it simply does what good electronic tuners do , accurately and without fanfare . 
bravo . 
when set on blink , they blink way too fast . 
when not set on blink , all 4 lights come on and focused into just 1 spot that the combined color come out white . 
useless design . 
they are not designed with a switch to have all lights on at the same time . 
so if you need that sort of control on your lights this will not do it . 
they are fairly bright and the lightweight metal body is nice . 
i bought this to go with my super champ x2 combo . 
it works . 
it also came with a cord.i was not happy the super champ x2 did n't come with it . 
both my hot rod deluxe and blues deville came with foot switches . 
and you really need the foot switch to use the x2 's various voicings and effects . 
now the x2 is my main amp . 
i really like the foot-switch . 
seems well made for the price and works as advertised . 
i just needed something to change channels on my fender super champ xd . 
i play a few stringed instruments , and ukulele is n't one of them . 
but after seeing so many great uke players lately - jake shimaukuro , joe brown - i had a hankering to try some ukulele playing myself . 
i wanted a playable instrument , and i did n't feel like spending a lot of money . 
i 've tried $ 30-40 ukes in stores that were big disappointments - bad intonation , no tone , etc. . 
after reading reviews here and elsewhere i decided to risk a purchase.result ? 
this is a surprisingly good instrument for less than fifty bucks . 
sure , it does n't have the volume or the rich tone of a soprano with a solid top , but it delivers good tone , excellent intonation , and good playability at a very good price . 
it may not be a 5-star intrument - but it 's a 5-star value.if you 're thinking about trying ukulele , but you 're not sure you want to buy an expensive instrument right away , i would strongly recommend an lu-21 . 
even after you buy a better uke , this is a great one to keep on hand to shove into the hands of unsuspecting guests , so that you can play ukulele duets ! 
i bought one of these used that was just like new when i got it . 
the craftsmanship is amazing as is the sound quality of this little ukulele . 
the build quality , the aquila strings , and the tuning keys are very high quality . 
you can sound great with one of these little instruments in no time . 
i downloaded a lanikai booklet off the internet and was on my way . 
it is pure fun to play one of these ukuleles.i bought this for my granddaughter and would suggest a larger model for any adult with larger fingers . 
some of the chords are hard to form due to the small size of the frets . 
i am still stoked at playing this until my granddaughter takes over on this one . 
this pedal was purchased to replace an oem pedal for my synthesizer , it works as expected and has proven to be durable . 
i do n't hesitate to drop it in my gig bag , knowing it will be ready to rock and roll at the next show . 
i was a little concerned after reader some of the reviews here , but the warranty , blue 's reputation , and amazon customer service convinced me to give it a try . 
and in general , i 'm pretty satisfied with it . 
using it with one of my oktava mk-301 microphones i get excellent sound , no hum , and so far , excellent reliability . 
i 'm using it with audacity and a few other programs , none of which have any difficulty recognizing it . 
there were some issues setting it up initially , and i 'm a bit leery about the plastic construction , but for what i paid i think it 's a good value . 
for those thinking of using it in field recording - stick it inside a carrying bag , and tape the cable to it to prevent stressing the usb connector . 
you should n't have any problems . 
this transfers my xlr mic to my usb laptop . 
simply plug it in and find the right drivers . 
my only issue is that the device would be better if they made it with a more durable plastic . 
it does seem like it can break easily . 
thankfully i will never have to move it around much on my desk . 
all in all , it works and i am pleased . 
i got this for one of my guitar students whose mom just wanted a cheap case for her acoustic guitar . 
now , let 's be clear - this is easily worth $ 16 , but it is a very bare-bones gig bag . 
it will protect your instrument to a degree - it only has minimal padding - and is probably good enough for any beginner instrument . 
one of my students has one of those esteban infomercial guitars , which is pretty low quality -lrb- but not terrible and not unplayable -rrb- , and the gig bag for that instrument has no padding whatsoever.i only give 3 stars because for a little more money it 's possible to get something which i feel is noticably better . 
i have a musician 's friend acoustic gig bag that i paid ~ $ 20 for a few years ago , and it 's well made and probably has twice the padding of this thing.so , this is n't bad , it 's worth the price , it 's put together just fine , but it only just barely serves its purpose of protecting your instrument , and i 'd never trust this with an instrument of any value . 
gig bags can be a good alternative to a hard case if space or weight are a concern . 
this isnt ' a bad choice , but just be aware of what you 're getting . 
thought about buying the -lrb- expensive -rrb- g7th capo , but i 'm very glad i did n't . 
the tried and true shubb works great at a great price . 
i do n't use it much but it 's nice to know that when i do i wo n't have to mess around with or detune to make it sound right . 
the difference between this one and ` clamp on style ' is night and day . 
this is a very useful little device . 
i use this cleaner on my strings after any use of my guitar . 
it removes anything on the strings and dries them immediately . 
this will increase the life of your strings . 
do n't expect miracles , but this helps quite a bit . 
i have bought this for me and several guitar-playing friends that have found this much useful . 
highly recommended . 
cheers ! 
this is great idea to clean guitar strings . 
i 've always wiped down the necks of my guitars but this allows you to clean the underside of the strings as well as the top.simple to use , small to fit inside a case or gig bag and not expensive.using this will help lengthen the life of your strings and pay for itself in no time . 
simply the easiest , no hassle , no mess , way to clean your strings . 
i have used on all my guitars . 
it even fits my acoustic 12 string!update : 1 year later and the string cleaner is going strong . 
wash up in soap and water and let dry . 
i bought a 2nd one ! 
nifty little item that does what it 's designed to do.realistically , it 's not worth $ 10.00 . 
$ 5.00 ? 
yes.save your money.i regret this purchase for what i paid for it . 
i bought this since i am a new guitar player ... it does hit the frets but does n't seem to do any damage ... pretty easy to use.the only oddity i have is that the box was kind of open already when i bougt it new.does the job . 
i ordered this pedal based on the previous 2 reviews , but to me it sounds very tinnie and cheap , plus the control knobs were a bit tight and hard to adjust . 
i do a have a few behringer pedals and many are very good for the price , but this one i wo n't be keeping . 
to me , it was n't even close to as good as the fender amp reverbs ... yes , it 's cheap plastic . 
yes , the battery life is very short as this unit sucks the life out of a battery in a couple of hours . 
yes , the battery is difficult to replace . 
however , this is the best sounding cheap reverb pedal on the planet . 
i solved the battery problem by using a 1-spot 8-outlet pedal power supply . 
it does n't sound nearly as cheap as its construction or price might suggest . 
everything from simulated spring reverb to endless caverns is here , and it all sounds great . 
it even has a `` modulated '' reverb , which is a reverb with a slight flange/chorus affecting the reverb signal only -lrb- not the dry signal -rrb- which is their version of the holy grail 's `` flerb '' setting . 
this is about 1/3 the cost of the holy grail , and the foot switch should hold up well under normal stage use -lrb- unless of course , you are an elephant -rrb- . 
for all the complaining i hear about this and other pedals with `` cheap plastic cases '' , i have yet to hear about anyone actually breaking one while using it . 
behringer pedals are hit and miss , but this one is certainly a hit . 
this is a good product . 
the construction is pretty good . 
it will give you a variety of bass tones . 
you have to buy a 1/8 trs to a 1/4 ts adaptor to line out to your amp or sound system . 
fits nicely and tight on standard wide threaded microphone stands . 
if you have the smaller `` screw headed '' ends on your microphone stand , you can get a little threaded adapter at any music store for next to nothing . 
-lrb- maybe a dollar , if they do n't just give it to you . -rrb- 
using this with stands that have a heavy round base takes up less space onstage and other places , as well as making it easy to relocate and keep out of the way.no need for a tripod stand with the legs folding up and out , getting in the way , plus most inexpensive tripods are cheaply made , very light and will break easily when moving gear or simply tripping over them.the base screws down all the way onto the stand until it is hand tight.the set screw allows for tilting and turning adjustment of the camera.the set screw presses against a ball-socket hinge and has a plastic thumb knob that seems a little fragile . 
i am very careful not to over-tighten in fear of twisting off the plastic thumb tightening knob.i am also leery of stripping the set screw or the threads inside the housing , but at this price i guess you ca n't expect to have a sophisticated adjustment mechanism , eh?there is a notch in the side of the housing to allow for a 90-degree preset angle.the metal thumbscrew that attaches the base of the camera to the adapter has a rubber washer as well as a thin rubber mat acting as like a cushioning gasket when tightened to your camera.be careful . 
the metal thumbscrew can easily fall out from the holding plate when transporting , removing or switching cameras . 
i found a little ` plastic threaded washer-like ring ' that screws onto the holding plate screw when not in use . 
you could easily find many types of washers , screws , plastic pieces , etc. , to hold it in place when in storage or transport . 
you could also leave it attached to your camera . 
either way , be careful not to let it fall out and get lost.overall the `` little thing '' is quite solid , heavy and sturdy and takes up little to no real estate and does a great job at being small , basic , solid and inexpensive.it holds well when bumped or moved . 
mine has absolutely `` no slop '' in it , does not wobble or come loose . 
i would not put a larger sized 8mm camera or heavy camera on this adapter . 
most modern devices will do just fine.again , just make sure you tighten it up ` just enough ' to hold it well . 
do n't put the grip of hercules on it and it should last for years . 
mine has.i 'm happy with mine and bought our drummer one for christmas.hope this helps ! 
works well , pretty straight forward . 
a little over priced for what it is , but , sure beats having to purchase another complete stand . 
i already had one of these for the studio from another vendor and picked this one up as well . 
it was really old and dusty like its been laying around for years but that aside it works perfectly to put my camera right where i need it . 
holds zoom recorder as well with no issues when i am recording . 
this works perfectly to transform any mic stand into a more than worthy tripod . 
the plastic knob that you use to tighten the ball and socket does n't grip very well and even the lightest camera will slip and sag . 
it 's a great idea but not well executed . 
i guess i have tried about every type of pick around . 
thick ridged things with thin strumming edges , great big triangles oh do you remember cork circles on one side ? 
look this is just easy , the star hole means i grip it and it does n't move until i let go . 
never had one break and the gauge being marked is so much nicer than digging through the `` pick pen '' on the counter of the local music store trying to find 3 that feel right . 
yup 3 'cause they were three for $ 1.00 definitely holds the guitar well . 
a little pricey but probably worth it . 
i 'm a fan of dunlop in general but think they got it right with this one . 
if all you want is amp-like vibrato and chorus , here ya go , and it 's cheap and cool looking -lrb- bigger footprint than a boss pedal -rrb- . 
the ` hue ' control gently affects the tone . 
moen pedals are great . 
nice quality at an unbelievable price point . 
this pedal is no exception . 
it is a great sounding vibe with the bonus of a nice chorus which can be engaged by the toggle switch . 
to be fair i have not tried many other vibes . 
hard to when most cost over twice the cost of this pedal . 
that being said i am absolutely pleased with the sound of this pedal and have had no need to look elswhere . 
vibe is very trower like . 
think bridge of signs . 
chorus is on the mellower side . 
very analog sounding not digital . 
replaced my bbe mind bender and fits the bill so much better . 
solid well built and should last . 
i would have no problem gigging with this and have with no issues.my only issue was that after a year or so the pedal seemed a bit less strong in its affect . 
i read online that a bit of electrical tape around the internal led 's would fix the problem and indeed it did . 
it 's been fine since . 
despite this needed fix i would buy this pedal again with no hesitation if i needed to why not ? 
for the price and some reviews i found online , i had to try this pedal . 
i bought one myself and it has remained on my pedalboard since i 've bought it . 
note : i recently put this right after my wah and before my dirt boxes and i 've found that it does two things ; 1 . 
the vibe sound does n't get smooshed and retains a more rounded sound and 2 . 
any volume drop you might experience having this after some od/distortion seems to be less . 
i suggest playing around and trying this pedal in different places on your pedal chain to see what works best for you . 
for me , it will stay before my od pedals and fuzz . 
do yourself a favor and check out some youtube demos of this . 
mine is musicman587 ... this is the pedal after pedals , but you 'll get a good idea of the general settings i use it on . 
summaryat $ 20 it is a great size and `` ok '' quality to round up a bunch of various stands you may carry to a band practice or gig . 
other options are available slightly longer and also with a 2nd compartment inside . 
no padding or impact resistance is provided , but gets a bunch of stands in one bag with a handle . 
also available 8 '' longer or with 2 chambered configuration on different models.pros : - good size for speaker stands , mic stands , guitar stands , music stands other than the top shelf , and other `` what-not '' you may want to cram in there , depending on your style . 
- affordable at $ 20 - availalbe on prime shippingcons : - this model is one compartment . 
for speaker stands , you may want a 2 compartment model . 
- lack of any impact resistance - the bag has no padding at all . 
it is just canvas . 
- it would be great if they made one of these just a little wider to be able to accomodate music stands.detailsin one of my 50 '' bags , i was able to put : - 4 folding mic stands - 1 music stand , other than the top piece with the shelf -lrb- that does not fit , even if the bag was empty . -rrb- 
- 2 folding guitar stands - and still had room for some more if i wanted to put more in . 
- bag was getting kind of heavy at that point.in a sconed 50 '' , i was able to put : - on stage stands oss ss7761b speaker stands - they fit with extra room on the ends in this 50 '' bag . 
- there is additional room to add mic or guitar or music stands - i am considering exchanging this one for a 2 section 50 '' bag so the speaker stands are separated , but probably will just keep this one.the bag has no padding at all - it is just canvas and a zipper and handles . 
when laying empty it is 50 '' long x about 12 '' wide and lays flat . 
seems strong enough to round everything up and tote it around , but for $ 20 , serves a basic purpose with affordability . 
like my title says , this gets the job done , and is well built . 
do n't waste your money spending on premium brands like monster cable and get this instead . 
i challenge anyone to a blind test who can say they can tell a difference . 
nice cables for the price . 
nice to have a good name on them , and very useful for my band 's mixer rack setup . 
this is a great xlr cable and does the job for what i need it to , which is attach my dslr shoe to an external shotgun mic . 
it has low noise , clean sound/good transmission . 
the only issue is that this particular cable , more-so than any of my other ones , is hard to get a locking click on anything it attaches to on either end . 
once it 's attached it 's fine , but then it 's the same coming off , i have to pull much harder than with my other cables and it makes me worried i 'll damage a microphone . 
with expensive equipment , i 'd use a different cable as the tight grip on both the male and female sides worries me . 
i bought this guitar nearly a year ago . 
it was my first guitar . 
i never cared much for the sound . 
it always sounded out of tune , even when it was in tune . 
i eventually bought an acoustic guitar to learn to play and have been happier with it than this squier . 
my skills are slowly improving but i wanted another electric so i sprang for a epiphone les paul . 
yes , it 's 3x more expensive than the squier bulletstrat - but it sounds 10x better.if you buy a squier , i think you need to be prepared to make this a `` project '' guitar . 
you 'll probably want to replace the tuners , pickups , bridge , etc.or just buy a better guitar to begin with . 
at this price point you probably wo n't find much better but you probably want to spend a little more for a much better guitar . 
great for a beginner electric.needed new strings but everything else was smooth.pick up a set of slinky strings and all is well . 
many years ago i had a fender stratocaster and i had to get rid of it , so now i have the closest that i will ever get to that guitar again . 
this one sounds great and looks good , and the price is great as well . 
i initially wanted a yamaha pacifica 012dlx - guitar center in eugene claimed to have stock in website - but when i reached there - there was n't any . 
so i tested an affinity and a bullet hss instead - and thought the bullet was pretty ok - but they did not have the color i wanted . 
so i ordered through amazon - but i bought a microcube from guitar center as i 'm greatful for the opportunity to test guitars.i waited for 2 weeks before i make this review so that it would be accurate and not based on initial impression.i received the guitar in perfect condition - it came in a brown box shipping with no pictures or nice colors . 
just a few words squier by fender . 
new strings and scratch free . 
made in china it says . 
however - it did not have sharp frets like i experience with some 100 bucks guitarsthe action came very high and i had intended to return it - but the guitar was perfect and i could n't find any fault to return . 
so i proceed to setup the guitar through 3 long and painful steps : 1 -rrb- straightened the neck by adjusting the truss rod . 
2 -rrb- then measured the string action height and set it from 1.5 mm for the first 3 strings and 2mm for the last 3 strings . 
3 -rrb- setup the intonation using a tuner . 
you really need a tuner for this step.after that , the guitar was splendid . 
it did go out of tune in 2 or 3 days but stabilized after that . 
i do not use the trem bar for fear of losing the tuning.after 2 weeks , i 'm still loving the guitar . 
beginners be warned - you may like the action or may need to do setup like i did . 
in fact i 'm so impressed with squier that i 'm thinking of getting the squier standard strat next - pretty curious of the alnico pups.latest review : downgraded from 5 to 3 stars.i bought a washburn rx40 with duncan usm.the bullet is nice but i outgrew it.the tuners are hard to tune as they are not sensitive.the bullet has little sustain unless you want to experiment with it by changing strings , tusq nut , locking the trem down . . 
etc.i 'd recommend to save some money and buy something above $ 200 . 
guitars at that price may be twice the cost , . . 
but is more than twice better.the 2 important things are not in bullet : the sustain and the sound.latest review : the product is back at 5 stars!i got the sustain to improve by increasing the action.fret buzz causes the the sustain to be cut short.there some sounds that a strat can do that humbuckers type guitar fall short ... like attack finger plucking . 
what makes a good cable ? 
one that works . 
i 've had these xlr cables fail because the pins get loose , so i hope this does n't happen to this one . 
got this because i thought the length would be enough . 
it was , but i wanted more mobility so went to the longer length . 
had no problems with this cable though . 
works great ! 
i use this soft flexible cable between my 48 volt phantom ps , and the mic connector to my system because it need not be long to do its job . 
no audible hum detected when using this mic cord , either . 
feels solid , and will probably last for many years to come . 
i tried this at the store . 
it looks like it would protect a guitar , but the latches are kind of large and clumsy . 
the interior was nothing special either . 
i passed . 
i recently traveled across country carrying 2 similar guitars , a fender american standard strat and a fender american standard telecaster . 
one was in the skb fender case -lrb- $ 99.95 on amazon -rrb- , the other in a gator case purchased locally . 
i was told it was just as good as the fender case . 
both ended up in checked luggage . 
after 1 flight from florida to lax and back -lrb- non-stop , minimal handling -rrb- the glue on the top section of the gator case gave up . 
the padding is now loose and the strap to keep the top from flopping completely open is dangling inside the case . 
neither guitar was damaged and the cases appear in fine shape , but with the padding loose , the gator case is going to require some repair before it can be used again . 
other than a couple of scuff marks on the skb fender case , it 's as good as new . 
i just ordered another skb fender case . 
the gator will be re-glued and used only for local trips with cheaper guitars . 
the skb fenders will be my airline cases from now on . 
i had two of these and wound up selling one because i never used it . 
the one i kept is currently serving as a keyboard amp for two keyboards -lrb- simultaneously -rrb- : aroland rd-300nx digital stage pianoand aroland v-combo 76 key stage keyboard . 
i was able to do this because there are two inputs on the front of the amp . 
input 1 is designed for normal sensitivity and input 2 is designed for guitars with active pickups . 
thus far i have had no problems with both boards connected at the same time , and it does not seem to matter which board is connected to which input.the sound is impressive . 
exceptionally clean , and the amp provides controls to allow you to contour your sound , which helps significantly when running keyboards through it . 
moreover , the amp is loud if you choose to make it so , and even at high-gain settings it has ample headroom.if you want distortion , this is probably not the amp for you . 
you can switch it from clean to drive to more drive , but it is essentially still a clean sounding amp . 
i find this to be a plus , but i have met my share of guitarists who think otherwise.another great feature is you can daisychain these amps using the pre-out on the master to the pwr-in on the aux amp -lrb- s -rrb- . 
you can also use these two jacks to run an effects loop . 
i personally have no use for those features , but i can see how they could be useful.overall , i love the amp and wish fender made a single 12 '' model because it is pretty heavy and bulky . 
those are hardly significant complaints since i sometimes regret selling my second one because if something happens to the one i still have i would replace it immediately . 
i put these on my dlx players strat but it was n't a piece of cake . 
first problem ... no instructions came with the package . 
found a method done by another searching online . 
served as a guide . 
second , after removing the old fender tuners i noticed the new tuners did n't fit into the slots . 
this meant drilling out the holes by another 1/8 of an inch . 
blue tape both sides as to prevent marring . 
third , the new unit using a tightening center nut rather than screws to the headstock . 
there are also with two dimples . 
i used a ruler clamped to the headstock for keeping straight alignment and another clamp to press the dimples into the tock for drill bit placement . 
then carefully drilled two holes per tuner . 
take you time on all of this as not to damaged the finish on the headstock . 
these rest was simple . 
install the tuners and tighten the nuts is now a breeze . 
if you are not mechanically inclined then i strongly suggest you go to a luthier as this is more than a simple replacement job . 
for the price you think they at least provide specs and some instructions . 
these are a direct drop in replacement on fender standard -lrb- mim -rrb- stratocasters , fender american standard , fender american deluxe.i have replaced my tuners of this style with fenders locking version that looks just like these but has a thumbwheel on the back.unfortunately , the locking ones are difficult to get in a gold finish . 
-lrb- but you can get them , ultimately . -rrb- 
i ordered a set of these non-locking ones - the finish is nice and is the deep dark gold that matches fender 's / schaller 's gold hardware . 
-lrb- not all gold hardware is the same color gold -rrb- . 
the quality is good and they look and function well . 
however , i returned them because they are not locking ... i ultimately decided a locking tuner was more important for the guitar i was building.if you just want gold tuners , do n't care about the string locking feature , and are playing a fender strat or tele - you ca n't beat these . 
by comparison to a lot of the gold tuners , the price of these on amazon is quite reasonable too . 
i was doing research on a new guitar rig and i kept seeing this amp mentioned . 
almost all of the reviews i read were positive . 
i decided to order it for a home practice amp when i do n't want to dig out my main rig.the build quality is solid - it feels like a much more expensive amp . 
many amps in this price range seem cheap and poorly constructed . 
i was really impressed with the packaging , the documentation and the build of the amp . 
this is my first fender amp and probably not my last.the sound quality is amazing . 
being a heavier rock/metal player , i would never have chosen a fender amp even for home practice . 
the first channel has a wonderful clean tone and the second channel has several modeled amps . 
the tone ranges from clean to jazz to high gain . 
there is even an acoustic model , and it sounds pretty good too . 
there are a ton of youtube videos of people demoing the sounds of this amp so i wo n't go much further into this.the included effects are simple but pretty cool as well , and can be switched on and off via the optional foot switch.overall i 'd say that this is a great amp for the price , and like many others , i highly recommend it . 
fit my mim strat perfectly , not much else to say . 
always buy fender parts for fender guitars , dont be cheap and order china copies on ebay , they wont fit . 
does what its suppose to . . 
only giving it 4 stars because they should have a multiple preset switch available rather then only letting you do one this switch goes with the fender blues jr. . 
iii series of tube amps . 
the connector is well hidden , it is up underneath the main badge on the back of the amp and you have to reach up underneath to find it . 
these are single channel amps , the foot switch activates the fat switch , which gives a little extra boost to folks playing single coil pickups . 
for an lp or other double coil the switch is almost overkill . 
but this is the switch for that amp . 
i needed a single button switch for my little mustang i that i practice on . 
i 've never owned the fender model switch but i know what it is . 
it will do the job but it 's lightweight and wo n't sit flat on the floor if the cord is n't laying exactly right . 
i searched a little further and ran across this switch on amazon by scrolling down a bit . 
`` marshall footswitch , one button with led by amplifiedparts . '' 
folks , this thing is built like a tank . 
the casing is made of heavy duty -lrb- i do n't know what gauge -rrb- solid steel . 
there 's nothing rinky dink about it . 
i plugged it in to the ftsw jack , clicked the button , the led lit up and the amp switched to the other tagged preset . 
again , light went out and back to the original . 
it felt solid under my foot and i do n't think one can tear the casing up unless they have a 3 or 4 lb . 
sledge hammer . 
i do n't know how well the electronics will hold up -lrb- i just got it today -rrb- but the switch , again , feels solid like it 's supposed to . 
it cost me $ 20.90 with shipping . 
it takes a couple of days longer to arrive than what we 're use to with amazon but it ships directly from amplifiedparts , i believe . 
i 'm a fender fan but this beats their single switch . 
thanks for reading guys . 
lane h. i 've noticed that the two-button tremelo/vibrato pedals for the fender deluxe reverb re-issue and twin reverb re-issue break down pretty quick . 
this replacement , so far , is hanging in there . 
this is a simple footswitch that allows you to switch between two different presets on your fender mustang amp . 
it is very easy to use , and works exactly as advertised . 
this switch is not bulletproof , but works great for playing around with your small practice amp . 
mr miyagi could n't have said it any better.robust , compact unit which i use with a fender rumble 75 . 
plenty of lead so i can position it where i need it , and thank heavens for duct tape . 
this works great with the mustang i amp . 
switches between to preset channels with just a tap of the foot . 
a great addition to an already great amp . 
at this price it 's kinda like the amp itself - a no brainer ! 
should have paid the extra $ 40 and bought the mustang - oh well . 
the amp has light sound and not much control . 
good for my small space though . 
great price but unfortunately this product did n't work for me . 
fortunately i had no problem returning it for a full refund so overall i 'm happy with the results . 
this works in some applications , but does n't work in many others . 
even when detected by the software , it will not work with line 6 equipment . 
too bad , because it would have been convenient to program my effects with my laptop instead of my desktop . 
when i plugged this into my computer and keyboard , it said one midi device detected , but i was not getting sounds from my piano onto my computer . 
i simple took the midi in and the midi out and switched them , and the problem was instantly solved . 
if your midi is not working right , try what i did , switching the cables to the opposite side . 
sounds ridiculous , but it might save you a bit of time . 
:d i 've been using this for a year to home record through midi and its a great buy . 
this was so much less expensive than a lot of other ones but it works just fine . 
no regrets on the buy at all . 
my advise - spend more and get something that will work with all applications . 
cheap midi may get you there , but if not you have to buy another . 
yep , always the gamble . 
cheap , works great for playing and foot controllers . 
will not handle bulk dumps , so i have to use a different interface for programming and backups . 
my puppy destroyed my name brand midi cable . 
i bought this to fill the gap until i could by another name brand but since it works so reliably i 'll saving my money for other things . 
if the puppy murders this one i 'll order up another one just like this . 
we went to the local gc to try out different guitars , mostly blind to the price , just looking to see what we liked best . 
after a couple of hours , we found ourselves repeatedly coming back to the cordoba c5 . 
it has a nice resonant sound , good playability , and very attractive finish . 
the room we were in at gc had classical guitars up to $ 1200 and we really did n't find a guitar we liked better . 
we had a $ 50 coupon , so we bought it from gc , but afterwards took it to our local music shop to have their tech look it over for us . 
he was also very impressed , especially with the fact that unlike most classicals , this one has a truss rod adjustment . 
it required only some minor adjustments and not a complete setup . 
i snagged this beauty during a holiday sale here on amazon and this baby is wonderful for the price . 
i previously had thelucero lc100 classical guitar black -lrb- black -rrb- which i was completely happy with as a beginner . 
when it got damaged beyond repair , i looked into thecordoba dolce 7/8 size classical guitarwhich was absolutely wonderful but i decided i did n't really like the size , so after liking the cordoba brand i decided on the c5.it is absolutely a wonderful guitar at this price range . 
the lucero was great for my level and it was decent enough to look at but the c5 has a vibrancy and deep tone to it that i was surprised to hear from a budget guitar . 
while it is n't it the prettiest guitar out there , it 's by no means ugly . 
even though mass produced a lot of quality is still apparent in this guitar.the smell of this guitar is also amazing . 
it does n't have the cheap wood glue smell of other low-end guitars , but a nice rich smell of wood . 
even after a few months , kept in a humicase , the sound is great and that fresh wood smell is still present.all praise aside , it is not a flawless guitar . 
my main complaint would be that the action is really high but this is something that is pretty common with new guitars , especially those at a lower price range . 
not necessarily a flaw but something to be aware of : being a cedar guitar , the wood is very soft so i recommend wear soft clothing without buttons or zippers on it while playing because these will leave small dents on the back of the guitar.i do enjoy the padded gig bag and thought that it was a nice touch to the package . 
it is a high-quality gig bag with lots of padding . 
inside the bag is a velcro neck rest with a strap to keep the guitar in place . 
it also has a large front packet that is large enough for a few music books . 
when i ordered this guitar from amazon , the guitar shipped inside the gig bag and inside of a big box . 
i had no issues with shipping and the guitar arrived safely.overall , i do not regret this purchase and once i take it in for a setup to get the action lowered , it will be a superb guitar that i will enjoy for years . 
highly recommended ! 
wow , is what my teenage son said when he opened this on christmas morning . 
he loved the variety & number of picks ! 
this was a terrific deal.my son loses picks all over the house and plays electric and acoustic , so i decided to get this mixed batch and he says they are great . 
purchased it to use on a 00-28 slotted headstock martin and it just did n't fit well for me . 
also found it extremely difficult to attach and remove . 
a string style worked a lot better , was a lot easier to attach and remove , and provided a lot more options for where it good be placed . 
its working great , but it does not work in stereo . 
it is a mono adapter , the stereo adapters are a little more expensive . 
for macs but fyi it goes out after 45mn and just need to be unplugged and back in . 
not a big deal . 
the audio jack on my laptop was failing . 
i had to wiggle and twist the headphone plug until i could hear both channels . 
by that time half the youtube video was over . 
what a hassle ! 
i 'm trying to imagine how can i crack the case , get in there with my soldering gun to replace the audio jack when i ran across this great idea . 
a plug-and-play usb device with both input and output audio jacks . 
took about one minute to install on my dell inspiron , which recognized it immediately . 
problem solved quickly and elegantly.shipping was free and prompt from the amazon partner . 
good job , platinum micro , inc. i understand the input jack is mono so do n't try to use this as a quasi recording studio . 
and consider the availability and accessibility of your usb ports . 
then , order this great little solution to a big problem . 
as a disclaimer , i am not a big muff connoisseur . 
i 've never owned one before this . 
i also tend not to like fuzz as an affect . 
i 'd characterize this box as a cross between distortion and fuzz , maintaining enough definition for chord work . 
if you 're reading the reviews , you 've probably already done your research on the features , but i 'll cover them anyway.three simple controls , volume - tone - sustain , with the sustain control being more or less a gain control . 
the enclosure is a smaller , pedalboard-friendly size . 
the pedal incorporates two of the -lrb- supposedly -rrb- most popular big muff mods with switches , tone and wicker . 
when tone is switched off , the tone control and its tone-shaping circuitry are completely disconnected . 
in this mode , the distortion applies to the entire tonal spectrum evenly , and it also produces a significant volume boost . 
the tone knob does nothing.when wicker is switched on , it removes three high-frequency rolloff filters that were added to the original big muff circuit to smooth out the sound . 
disconnecting these makes the sound a bit raspier and rougher , with a high-end frequency boost.i use this pedal running into a mild overdrive , the catalinbread dirty little secret , which `` conditions '' the signal . 
i play with the tone off and wicker on , and even with the volume and sustain controls set fairly low , this combination results in a wonderfully thick , massive distorted tone that is still pretty smooth.if you 're looking to get a big muff , and you 're not a snob about which version , the switchable mods on this one are really great for experimenting to find your own sound . 
not to mention that , at this price point , it will be much cheaper than some vintage muffs . 
highly recommended . 
my big muff pi with wicker had hellacious noise , i mean unusable . 
i noticed it would change with movement so i pulled the back off and immediately found paint overspray where the grounding spring from the circuit board meets the inside of the housing . 
after aggressively scraping the paint off , the pedal operates as i would expect it to.i really like the tone and aggressive drive of the big muff and the tone and wicker switches are nice although i find that with the wicker opened up/on the noise level gets marginally too high ; so long as you 're playing hard and loud it 's not really an issue . 
this pedal is n't designed to be quiet when you 're not playing so do n't be fooled there , it is normal for it to make some noise when there 's not guitar input/strumming . 
the bypass on the other hand seems to be clean as advertised.i 'll be keeping the pedal and like it but the lack of qa from my proudly made in america fuzz pedal was a bit of a let down ; fortunately i found the problem and fixed it myself to avoid a return . 
the mat is only a few $ neoprene -lrb- kind of -rrb- mat , the neck holder thing is inserted in the tube that contain the mat ... take it out very very carefully , i was only careful and the base of the neck holder broke a bit ... in my opinion this thing if priced $ 15 or $ 20 less will be what it really worth on the market.p.s.the wise man say : do yourself a favor , use a long pillow over your desk to tune up/intonate your strat or tele and use this $ $ to buy good strings ! 
:d this product makes changing strings on a guitar easy ; a must for anyone with any type guitar . 
it is basically the same thing sold or made all the major brands of guitars . 
it holds the guitar secure while changing strings or making adjustments . 
it also is easy to store when finished . 
yup , it 's o.k. nothing special . 
i do n't know if it 's the best one out there but it does the job . 
they have no grip at all they brake and ware out in a hour or so of hard playing there just junk for newbie that do n`t know any beter but hey what do you expect they are made by d addario get some real picks like dunlop tortex i think picks are like , well you know , a personal choice , i bought these cause they are simple , inexpensive and will compare to others i have . 
been using these lately . 
would buy again . 
i reshape my own pics on my grinder , and use nothing but heavy picks , there are just guitar picks . 
they are what you order . 
i fix mine up by adding stair tread floor stuff , so they do n't slip out of my hand . 
they do what they are meant to do . 
no complaint for the price and they have a pretty dang cool lookin design to them . 
these picks have served me very well . 
i am happy with the quality of all of them . 
i would purchase additional planet waves assorted pearl celluloid guitar picks i have a few different brands of picks at home right now and these planet wave picks are much nicer than the others . 
they are clean cut , smooth finish . 
nice texture and looking . 
i reach for these first.would and will buy again and recommend ! 
hey it 's a pick , it 's 10 to a bag ... i lost one already so now i have 9 . 
i my world that 's good stuff . 
these picks were a filler item for a much larger order . 
i can always use guitar picks , however these are very pleasing to the eye and have a good quality feel . 
i bought these guitar picks for my son . 
he really likes them a lot . 
i would definitely buy them again . 
ok i do n't have much to say , just i love it because its cheap nice and i do n't know i just feel happy to buy this product i honestly do n't know alot about guitar picks but they seem to get the job done no problems here i have been using the same one since i got them and have not broke it yet lol these feel very good but they wear off quite quickly , so not pick taping and easy with the struming . 
also watch it if your alternate picking is with the pick almost at vertical . 
trying out a few new types of picks and different weights . 
i found this pick very responsive , flying through the scales on my les paul . 
the pick 's weight was perfect . 
it 's durable and easy-gripping . 
they are comfortable to use . 
the planet wave logo gives me a nice grip on the pick ; and i like heavy picks , so the `` heavy '' option fits my preference . 
i 've got a gig tomorrow night , so we 'll see how they work then . 
like many say , they do slip out easy so you need to keep that in mind , otherwise for the price and overall quality they are good cables . 
how much can you say about a patch cable . 
this is a good one at a good price.i recommend it . 
use them for home recording , nothing on the road . 
for that purpose these are made well . 
wouldnt use these regularly for gigging wear and tear would break them down pretty quickly . 
i ordered two sets so that i could set everything up in nice orderly progression on my stomp box . 
heard no evidence of hum and they seem to work just fine keeping everything in order!by the way , these are listed as .5 feet -lrb- 6 '' -rrb- , but actually are 10 '' . 
wish i had measured as i ordered a 12 '' long cords thinking they would be twice as long . 
oooops , my bad when i discovered they were only 2 '' longer ! 
they do the job and are made well . 
i guess the high dollar cables are better but it 's hard to tell the difference . 
the cable is great material , the 90 's with boots are just right and have a lot of strength for durability . 
price is right for sure . 
i have a hard time paying for a patch cable that costs almost as much as a 20 ' cable . 
these are not cheap but they are priced much better than others . 
and they work great ! 
no loss of tone through these cables . 
if anything i had to do some eq adjusting because after using these i had a far greater signal -lrb- volume and frequency response -rrb- when i replaced my other patch cables with these!i love them !!! 
i was looking for something like this for a long time , if you are like me , that likes the analogical pedals this is a good option . 
trustable , quiet , good materials , durable , etc. . . 
maybe these are not the best when its about helping with the space on the pedalb bcuz of their large plug ` heads ' , but they do a perfect job with my guitar signal ... and honestly , for me , that 's what i need ... good stuff to have ! 
i figured i would splurge and buy these just to have some backup cables when i wear out the cheap guitar center ones -lrb- and have some that match -rrb- . 
they are well built and feel like they can take some abuse . 
i will probably but 2 more packs shortly to switch out all my cables . 
i thought it was my jack for a while , then i noticed it would n't stay in any pedal . 
there is no `` click '' assuring that the cable is in place ... and there 's a reason for that , it is n't ! 
slips right out of every pedal i have . 
not reliable . 
i have been playing for 17 years and have seen alot of patch cables . 
these are great quality and for the price you cant go wrong . 
these are currently the only cables i use on my pedalboard . 
short of monster or mogami , these are the best you can get for the money . 
these cables are really the best . 
they sound perfectly , they look and feel strong , their contact is perfect . 
life time warrany . 
recommended . 
i 've been buying these strings for a while now . 
they sound clean and crisp . 
the best part is the price . 
i am not a fussy person about guitar strings . 
they either sound good or they do n't to you and you are the one that matters . 
i was very pleased with getting 3 sets at this price delivered to my front door . 
there are so many different strings out there just go with the flow and look at the company logo on the outside . 
martin is at the top of the heap . 
these strings sound light and bright . 
very pleased with this purchase . 
they are a wonderful product ! 
the lighter the strings on your acoustic the less taxing to the neck of your guitar , with these you ca n't go wrong . 
good grippy picks for some types of playing . 
i go back and forth between these and the jazz iiis when i 'm in a jazz pick kind of mood -lrb- i.e. : when i 'm not using ginormous gypsy jazz picks or fender heavies . 
i especially dig davas -lrb- all models -rrb- for acoustic playing and strumming . 
nice tone as well . 
have tried pretty much every dava and each has its pluses for specific kinds of playing.one thing about davas is that once in a while the pick will slightly move in my grip , and i 'll pick the string with the rubber . 
hand angle can also play a part in this . 
probably just me . 
this thing has so many uses its ridiculous . 
i mostly use it to record live band rehearsals , and it 's pretty amazing at that . 
i 've also recorded interview audio and most recently used it as a usb interface for my daw when my other interface went kaput . 
if you are using this for film , music , field recording you will be very happy . 
easy to use interface and very well constructed . 
this pedal has tone ! 
its very easy to use and program , i did not have idea on how to use it , and really quick i got it , it has a great interface , it sounds great , you just need some time to adapt and you will be creating your own tones in no time.the distrosion is great some people say they arent but i really love them , its a matter of taste and creating your tones , some preset may not be good for youthe downside it does not have the ac adapter but i knew this.the lights under certain light conditions are very bright , but this pedal is note heavy , well constructed and sturdy , i got the ac adapter so i dont have to be on the batteries all the time.this pedal has the whole package , effects , great tone , great distorsion and cleans . 
i agree with other reviews that boss exploits its customers by insisting the $ 300 pedal have the psa supply , but sells it separately . 
it 's a cheesy way to meet a price point without really doing it . 
i used a onespot power supply i had already , and it works fine . 
just glad i did n't have to shell out $ 20 more to boss for something they should have provided with the me70.the first thing i noticed is that the tuner is not too good . 
you get a letter , with an arrow on each side , and it 's not very responsive.the korg-style dial-in reverb controls are easy , but extremely limited . 
expected better . 
you get either room or hall . 
neither are that realistic.going from manual patch-level to bank-level is awkward . 
it may just take practice.next thing i noticed is the delay level does not respond as expected . 
if i set the e. level -lrb- delayed signal level , or balance -rrb- at around thirty , it can be clearly heard . 
when overdrive or boost is added the primary signal is boosted as expected , but the delayed signal remains at the original volume , effectively reducing the balance and making the delayed signal nearly inaudible.did boss just start making multi-effects pedals ? 
have they learned nothing?despite somewhat mediocre performance and design , the me70 does have features that recommend it . 
some of the drives are usable . 
the controls are accessible and easy to adjust . 
the `` solo '' setting on the comp/fx module is a nice booster , although it can apparently be overdriven easily by the boost in the od/ds module - maybe this is by design but it would be nice to have two levels of clean boost.the next annoyance is the very limited capabilities of the optional footswitches . 
i was hoping to be able to flip between the preset and manual setting , but all it does is turn the preamp on and off , or step -lrb- one way -rrb- through the presents -lrb- fs-5u -rrb- . 
it almost appears that boss very cynically crippled the me70 so it did not threaten gt10 sales.i 'm looking forward to learning more about this pedal . 
so far , it does some good things , but it could be much better.has anyone else noticed the me70 reviews out there are n't too useful ? 
i 'm thinking of checking out the vox tonelab ex , which is being blown out now . 
$ 225 at gc , for example . 
-- 3/16/12 update : despite the limitations above , i like the portability of this unit . 
it runs on 6 aa 's -lrb- i think -rrb- which is great when you just want to put it on the floor and play , for example at a jam where you do n't have power nearby.new fail update - the tremolo in this unit just stinks . 
i mean stinks . 
whatever the `` waveform '' is , it 's not a sine wave , not smooth at all . 
very poor musical characterists . 
whatever engineer was in charge of this - you screwed up big time . 
your own boss tremolo pedals are much better than what you 've put in the me70 . 
why would you do that , boss ? 
i like tremolo but it 's virtually useless in this unit . 
some people wo n't notice , but if you like that swampy fender style tremolo , you will be very disappointed . 
just got this in this week . 
looks nice and works as intended . 
for 22 bucks , ca n't really go wrong . 
i use this with a behringer c1 and have had no trouble getting it to fit . 
it 's a bit snug , but i would prefer a snug fit over a loose fit . 
i got these for the build in pop screen . 
however i found it can only be attached in one place . 
this is ok if you are using a full boom that &#8217; s facing the singer . 
but if you are working in a tight space and the boom stand is to the side of the singer , this presents difficulties . 
it fits my mxl mic and any mic up to 52mm without a problem . 
i 've owned a lot of cables over the years , and most have been junk . 
for the money , there is no better instrument cable out there than the spectraflex . 
i 've regularly rolled 100-pound half stacks over them , jumped up and down on them , and tossed them in the back of a truck with all manner of jagged and unholy acoutrements , and they stay clean and work like the first day.pros : - proper shielding means this is a quiet , accurate cable - slick braided covering makes it super easy to untangle - very flexible - metal sleeves enable easy repairs should the unthinkable happen - available in some very cool colors - lifetime warrantycons : - none to speak of.spend a little extra money and get the best value cable on the market today . 
a lifetime warranty means you 'll have it forever . 
it sure is a pretty looking cable out of the box . 
the chord works great , no noticeable buzz . 
i had to have the tweed , to complement my vintage gear . 
i 'd have given this a 5 star rating , but because of the tweed/fabric outer , the chord is constantly fighting you with kinks . 
this is my first fatso-flex cable . 
i think i 've had spectraflex cables before , and they 've been fine , but i 've owned , lost , lent , etc. so many over the years i ca n't recall . 
the look and feel of this cable is excellent . 
seems very solid , but it 's always difficult to tell with cables . 
i like the flexibility much better than my monster cable , which is much stiffer and tends to want to coil back onto itself . 
the fatso is nice and flexible , and it looks fantastic . 
it sounds fine , no issues . 
i 'm not one of those who believes all the snakeoil about high-end cables being necessary . 
get something decent that is n't noisy , and the tone comes from you and your equipment . 
no issues in that regard with the fatso.one last thing - you 've got ta love amazon . 
i got a 10 ' red and a 14 ' violet for ~ $ 15 each , while other colors in the same lengths were twice the price or more . 
so , i was n't choosey about the colors i got . 
they look great , though . 
oh , and one thing i 'm a bit iffy about is spectraflex 's lifetime warranty . 
the fine print requires a sales receipt -lrb- bs imo -rrb- and says something to the effect of `` we will decide if we will replace it '' . 
so , way what you will about monster , but they 'll replace anything with no receipt , which is more reasonable , i think . 
but i 'll worry about that when it 's time to worry about it , but it 's worth considering , as the return process might not be exactly hassle-free . 
let 's ' be very clear from the start : the pedal board and the carrying bag are excellent quality . 
the board is solid , and the bag is very well made and will last a life-time . 
as other people have pointed out though , pedaltrain must have outsourced the decision to locate the strap d-rings to someone who has never carried anything over their shoulder . 
the only reason this is not a 5-star review is because of the d-rings . 
that being said , do n't let that detract you from buying this . 
i just feed the shoulder strap through the carry-handle and it works well enough . 
this is a review for themahalo u-30pk painted economy soprano ukulele -lrb- pink -rrb- . 
for the price -lrb- $ 30 shipped -rrb- it ca n't be beat . 
free shipping via amazon prime . 
i got it for my 3yo daughter for christmas , and she loves it ! 
i taught her the c-chord , and i play the g-chord ... so we play the moldy peaches `` anyone else but you . '' 
it 's a great little starter musical instrument , and a great beater uke that i do n't mind getting a bit banged up.i was surprised that the frets were level and the neck was straight -lrb- well , good enough for a cheap uke -rrb- . 
the strings are some kind of cheap nylon . 
i changed the strings to nylguts , and they sound 1000x better ... almost as good as my other laminate mahogany soprano -lrb- almost -rrb- . 
the fretboard is painted black , so i do n't know what kind of wood was used -lrb- i did n't expect ebony for this price -rrb- . 
i also sanded down the nut and saddle because the action was a bit high , and now even i can play it without complaining too much . 
it has geared tuners , not friction pegs.it even comes with a matching polyester `` gig-bag . '' 
now my mother wants one so she can play with her granddaughter . 
overall , a decent play/starter uke and worth the $ 30 . 
the u-30 is a decent starter 's ukulele , no matter what color you get , but it is not without its flaws . 
the tuners feel cheap , but they are functional , much better than friction tuners on `` toy '' ukuleles . 
the body paint is of good quality and resists scratches with ease , but the paint on the fretboard comes off easily unto your fingers . 
the string action is low , making it perfect for fast strum patterns . 
even for a soprano ukulele , this one has a higher pitched sound with little sustain , which is actually quite authentic for those desiring a more `` hawaiian '' sound , but the tiny sound and low sustain make playing along with other instruments problematic , unless using a microphone . 
the worst aspect of this ukulele are the strings , it takes forever to stretch them or `` break them in . '' 
this means that you must tune your ukulele virtually after every song , so beginning ukulele players should remember to get a chromatic tuner . 
chords that use the first fret , such as f and a sound distorted for some reason . 
replacing the included strings with aquila strings makes this ukulele much better , but the added cost puts it in the price range of what i would consider a true starter 's ukulele , the lanikai lu-11 . 
the included gig bag is almost useless , it has absolutely no padding and is very tight . 
in conclusion , its low price and distinctive high pitch `` hawaiian '' sound make up for its shortcomings . 
i would not recommend this as your only ukulele , or even a starter , since the problems with first fret chords will train your ear in a wrong way . 
i would recommend the u-30 as a backup or `` disposable '' ukulele that you can take anywhere , without fear of damaging or losing it , but for a little more money , you can get better . 
i should have researched this a little bit more . 
it was a gift for a child , but a child could n't tune this thing nor could i ! 
it was a toy , not an instrument . 
i doubt you can beat this for $ 25 ! 
the uke is a solid little guy . 
i shimmed the bridge a little because i can play hard , but it was n't bad . 
pretty well in tune up the neck . 
strings are ok but i do have some aquilas to put on ; will see if it matters much.the tuners are geared , not friction like in the one picture -- at least , mine are.the carrying bag is just that , with no padding or other protection , but keeps the rain off . 
i 've owned several multi-effect pedals in the past , even one digitech . 
up til now , they all had one thing in common : layers of menus to click thru to make any changes or adjustments . 
it was a pain . 
then i saw this one ... with knobs ! 
i did a lot of research , and was torn between the rp255 and the rp355 . 
i decided to go cheap and got the rp255 . 
so far , that was an ok decision . 
the rp255 has plenty of features , and is a good compromise between menus and knobs . 
i recommend reviewing the manual for your first day or two of orientation.to sum up the device quickly , the rp255 is probably capable of generating any sound or affect you want , but you may need to work at it . 
as with many multi-effect pedals , there is a selection of -lrb- 60 -rrb- factory tone/effect profiles , to save you the trouble of programming new ones . 
these are mirrored by 60 `` user-defined '' profiles , which are identical to the factory presets . 
the difference is that # 1-60 , can be modified by the user , or left as-is . 
the factory presets , # 61-120 , are not modifiable . 
so , you can really experiment with different setups without worrying about losing what came from the factory . 
you can also `` reset '' the entire device if you want to , but if you do you will lose all of your modifications.in addition to all the different tones and effects this unit has to offer , there are also two additional features which are very useful : a -lrb- pretty basic -rrb- drum machine and a 20 second looper . 
the looper is really why i bought this pedal . 
it 's easy to use , and it overdubs . 
i only wish digitech would have made it a 40 or 60 second looper . 
20 seconds really is n't much . 
fyi , you can not use the drummer and the looper at the same time . 
no biggie for me.ok , all that 's good , so why am i disappointed in this unit ? 
pretty simple . 
i 'm an older guy , who has been playing for approximately 50 years . 
i 've played every kind of music there is , and i would have appreciated a much broader selection of presets . 
this may be a slight exageration , but it seems like 95 % of the presets are some sort of -lrb- obnoxious -rrb- distortion . 
come on guys , not all of your customers are 13 years old ! 
i expect a professional piece of equipment to offer a variety of professional choices . 
now , i 'm faced with working out all of my own presets . 
i 'm back to programming menus again , ugh ! . 
so that 's about it . 
it 's a solid piece of equipment , with too many juvenile tone presets to choose from . 
in all honesty , if i had been aware of this , i would have probably not gotten this unit , inspite of its good design and quality . 
perfect cable for using with my small behringer 4 channel amp to plug into my mic slot on my small mixer . 
high quality and great sound . 
the question was , &#34; did it meet your expectations ? 
&#34; and it certainly did . 
it is heavy duty but also light . 
well , placed on a light duty cheapo stand it might be a little heavy but and basic quality stand will handle it no problem . 
it really seems well engineered and made of quality material . 
i mounted this on top of my on stage tripod mic stand to hold my small format mixer during gigs . 
works great works as well as my friend 's condenser mic that cost him three times as much . 
great mic for the price . 
i had read many reviews on sm57 clone microphones to see if there was anything that did the job . 
it seems everyone who has given an opinion on this subject all seemed to agree on one microphone . 
the gls es57 . 
-lrb- same with the sm 58/es58 -rrb- . 
i had to give it a shot . 
i run the sound for local bands and i use sm 's because they can take abuse and still sound great . 
only time will tell if this mic will be able to take the same amount of abuse but so far i really like it . 
the frequency band is not identical to the sm57 as some others have said . 
a little less bass but that does n't mean it is a thin sound - it certainly is not . 
i can get it to sound the same as the sm if i eq it slightly but i like the natural sound anyway . 
also , the signal is a bit hotter but i really like the tone for both vocals and for instruments . 
value for money it ca n't be beat . 
if you are on a budget , get one ... . 
i own a gls es-58 and am very happy with it so when i need a mic for my guitar cab i went with a gls-57 and could n't be happier . 
these mics are very solid and i ca n't tell them from the real deal . 
i have done side by side comparison of both the real 57 and knock off 57 mics and unless you are some kind of sonic freak i doubt you would notice any difference . 
i am about to purchase three more of these 57 mics for the rest of the bands intruments . 
i 've been using shure microphones live and in the studio for nearly thirty years now and i can honestly say that i can hear no audible differences between a genuine shure sm-57 and this gls audio es-57 . 
this is n't based on any scientific data , it 's based on a/b ` ing this mic and a shure 57 on the same tube amp at the same volume and distance going through the same mic pre . 
i made sure that i marked the exact location of the mic with a little masking tape on the amp 's speaker grill . 
i recorded about 30 seconds of the same simple chord progression first with the shure mic , and then this one . 
when you play them back either through studio monitors or some very good bose headphones you can hear no audible difference between the two . 
if you were to examine the tracks in a waveform editor i 'm sure you 'll see some visual differences -lrb- but they are also two different performances -rrb- , but my ears really hear nothing audibly different . 
some may disagree , but i 'm convinced.this mic is built solidly and weighs the same as the shure and for all intents and purposes looks almost identical both inside and out.is it as good as the shure ? 
i do n't know , i think so - others may not . 
i do know that you can buy three of these for the price of one shure 57 though . 
i 'd highly recommend these on guitar cabinets , snare drums , and toms for sure , maybe vocals in a pinch on a particular type of voice.a no-brainer as far as i can tell . 
wow , i will never buy another sm-57 again . 
i ca n't believe i 'm writing this , but it 's ture . 
i am so psyched that i found this microphone , it 's perfect.but seriously , the sound quality has never once disappointed me . 
in fact , and it might just be in my head , but i now prefer to use this when micing my guitar amp . 
but everyone else has talked about sound , so i want to talk about build quality.it 's solid , has some weight to it , and the plastic at the top feels exactly right : so far , it has n't come loose in the way that sm-57s do . 
if i handed this and a sm-57 to my grandma who does n't know any better , she 'd probably guess that the es-57 was a bit higher-end . 
i continually look at it and ca n't believe i only paid $ 30 for it.get one . 
nah , get a bunch ! 
sell your sm-57s for $ 60 and turn them into two of these . 
magic ! 
this is a great value ! 
i was able to record some very good quality guitar tracks using this . 
it does n't sound exactly like an sm57 , but it will get you close . 
you can eg your amp to compensate for the difference . 
this mike is an awesome value you could pay twice or three times more and the frequency response is excellent service was super fast i would 've no problem buying from these folks again in the future excellent tuner . 
i appreciate it 's compact size and often leave it attached to the headstock . 
it performs as it should and appears to be quite durable . 
being able to angle the unit is great . 
the back light works well in dim light and of course the piezo mode makes tuning in noisey invironments quite easy . 
they do mean it when they say to replace the battery when you get it . 
mine lasted for a couple of weeks . 
it was insightful of them to tell you of this need upfront . 
all in all well worth the money and the transaction went flawlessly . 
i 'll be brief and to the point here : + works as an audio interface for a line level signal . 
i used this with my samson mixer . 
+ is compact and the usb cable itself is long enough . 
+ the red color looks nice . 
+ has a headphone out with volume control + plug and play . 
no extra drivers needed . 
i use asio anyways . 
+ cheap . 
there 's no audio interface this affordable . 
+ latency fairly low . 
not bad . 
- plastic body - rca connectors . 
not a big deal but wouldve been perfect if it had dual plugs or phono -lrb- 1/4 inch -rrb- . 
- 44.1 khz and 16 bit sampling . 
should have been 24 bit and maybe 96khz . 
even my digitech rp255 has a built in 24bit audio interface . 
i previously had the uca-202 and it worked great for me for a couple of years but i noticed the audio went dead in one of the rca phono input jacks -lrb- i had used those jacks previously with no issues -rrb- . 
regardless , i liked the uca-202 so much that i got the uca222 to replace it without hesitation , plus as a bonus , it 's purdier ! 
:-rrb- plugged it in just now , fired up the pc , the new uca222 started working immediately ... no muss , no fuss ! 
for the money , i do n't think you can find a better deal for enhancing your pc 's audio versatility . 
i do n't know if i 'll even bother with the included software as i use a great program called mixcraft -lrb- btw , check that out if you 're looking for pc recording simplicity but sounds impressive as the other , costlier guys -rrb- . 
anyway , two thumbs way up for the uca222 ! 
if you are brave enough to drill into your ukulele for a strap these are for you , i was hesitant at first , but this did the job . 
it 's odd to review such a simple thing as screws : - -rrb- what can i say ? 
they 're shiny and screwed well into the holes . 
works well for acoustics , as well as electrics , i have amazon prime so i got it quick . 
well made and folds easily love these guitar stands ! 
sturdy and compact and at such a reasonable price . 
you will pay up to 4x more for similar stands ! 
great bargain . 
this is a pretty nice and well built lite weight guitar stand but i have another that is a bit nicer and i paid about the same for both . 
this particular stand is surely made for a very large jumbo guitar . 
small yet sturdy enough to hold a full-size guitar . 
nothing to put together , just spread the legs and place your guitar on the two holding arms . 
a very good price for an excellent product . 
item arrived on time and as described , item is solid and well designed . 
does not need and installation and setup , this item can be adjusted to fit different sizes of guitars . 
i ll buy more for the other guitars at my house . 
it 's a guitar stand that holds your guitar so it do n't fall down during a gig hurting potential fans and thier friends ... well constructed ... awesome price . 
this is a really strong capo . 
the spring is very robust . 
well padded , and will not damage your instrument . 
i have used it on guitars -lrb- electric and acoustic -rrb- , banjo , and mandolin . 
takes some hand strength to open it , but you do n't want a weak capo ! 
as soon as put it on my guitar , i enjoyed the way it got the job done . 
my first concern was , will this damage my guitar ? 
the answer is no . 
it is user friendly and guitar friendly . 
the price is so low , you should own at least one . 
no problems . 
just music . 
at the most competitive price available . 
this capo works fine , its strong and fits great on my spanish or steel string guitar , i would n't ask for something more capo serves me well and the spring mechanism has held up for a year now and does not show signs of deterioration . 
came on time . 
works very good . 
strong spring that good start . 
if needed i would buy another . 
for me and my son it works great . 
some say `` this capo work bad '' i have to ask `` are your guitar is good enough to use this capo ? '' 
or `` are you know how to use capo ? 
`` i 'm more than 20 years of playing guitar . 
this capo is worth the price . 
good quality and work great for not extream user -lrb- are you nuts ? -rrb- . 
best recomended quality and price . 
ps . 
may not for very big guitar neck ! 
enjoy ! 
i have bought 5 of these now for me and a few friends and they work great . 
i am sure they will wear out in time so i have a couple extras but you ca n't beat them . 
the music stand is quite sturdy and well made in my humble opinion . 
i needed a music stand that could support a note book of music i have assembled over the years . 
this was great . 
i added a clip on led light as well . 
perfect :--rrb- strong folds nice to bring it with you on a job . 
the price was right . 
may buy another for a spare . 
i bought this to go with my epiphone ukulele , for both myself and my grandson . 
it 's a good starter amp to see what your inexpensive ukulele or guitar sounds like with an amp . 
for the price , it 's good . 
if you have an acoustic/electric uke , this is an ideal companion if you take the uke to friends , beach , road trip , camping , etc. . 
it 's quite small , and easy to pack into a backpack or bag . 
it 's not a great electric amp , but it does a surprisingly good job amplifying a uke . 
use a 9-volt when you need it , or buy a 9v ac adapter to plug into an outlet . 
you ca n't find a better option on a budget , when fun and convenience is more important than audiophile-quality sound . 
i have to say this little guy packs a punch and for 20 bucks . 
i just needed something i could plug into that was super portable and cheap . 
also this works well with an iphone set up if you want to use some larger effects this little guy does n't come with . 
also this little guy does n't gobble up 9volt batteries like other guitar gear tends to do . 
the only minor flaw is it 's made out of plastic so if you need something more durable maybe get a solid state amp the plugs into a wall outlet ... our buy two more of these , they are only 20 bucks . 
in my opinion ... this is the best amp in this category . 
i know people who have the marshall and the fender . 
i plugged into my little honeytone and i had the best sounding micro amp hands down . 
they were both amazed with the sound . 
they said `` well mine was only $ 45 and `` mine was only $ 40 . '' 
too bad so sad for them . 
i told them mine was $ 20 . 
since it does n't say marshall or fender , i only had to pay 1/2 for a better sounding amp . 
if you are looking for an amp with 1 or 2 watts , and know what to expect from a micro , this amp does not disappoint seem to work well . 
keep the ground switch selected , and it will do just fine . 
i have used different direct boxes and i recommend this one . 
it stopped working after 2 gigs . 
i 'm not sure why , but it is very frustrating . 
i guess you get what you pay for here . 
this box is what i have been missing out of my setup . 
always getting the question , &#34; can i hook my keyboard into your sound board &#34; . 
feel good to say that now i have the capability now i 've bought several pairs of these for my guitars and no complaints yet . 
they all work flawlessly . 
i 'll definitely buy more and highly recommend them . 
just like schaller but fender branded and cheaper -lrb- asian made -rrb- . 
got a vintage instrument you do n't ever want to see hitting the floor ... well , here are is the long term 100 % secure solution ! 
there is a lot to think about with a strap lock ... is it 100 % sturdy ? 
100 % reliable ? 
does the design put undue stress or wear on the guitar ? 
can it fit in a case , or does it make you take the strap off every time you put your guitar away?the fender-schaller design covers all of these bases well . 
i believe it is 100 % sturdy and reliable . 
unlike it 's dunlop competition , the stress on the guitar is roughly equivalent to plain strap buttons . 
it will not fit in all cases , but will fit in many.i 've switched over to this design and could n't be happier with it.note : i advice using a crescent wrench and a socket to tighten the nut . 
one always wants to avoid over-tightening , but the risk of under-tightening is high without proper leverage . 
if you do n't really tighten the nut down , you are likely to have things fall apart while playing some day . 
i bought one of those padded fender leather straps -lrb- it says fs1 canadian leather on the back -rrb- . 
i thought these fender strap locks would complement the strap , but because of the padding the thread on the strap-lock was n't high enough for the nut to reach . 
i finally got the nut to get a hold of the top of the thread and although it works i do n't trust that its enough . 
if you have a padded leather strap i do n't recommend these . 
this is a very good strap lock system . 
i put it on my wolfgang guitar and it locked very properly my strap . 
recommended . 
this was a filler item for a much larger order . 
i am very interested in the straplocks , so i decided to give them a try . 
i sincerely like the concept . 
easy to install , i used the guitars existing strap button screws.straplocks came with black & white felt , that 's a nice touch . 
i think black looks better with my guitar . 
this pedal is `` ok '' by which i mean , i provides the basic functions it says it does . 
quality-wise , it feels a bit cheapish ... i was afraid i was going to snap a pot off or something while playing it . 
the case is metal but feels like the thinnest sheet metal they could get away with building it from . 
the power switch and chorus/vibrato switch were clearly the cheapest switches they could find , and are not that easily accessible by a toe ... you got ta bend over and flip those . 
they are small.on the other hand it was only sixty-nine-bucks - relatively inexpensive for a multifunction affect pedal.i do n't care for the rear facing upwardly angled input , output and power jacks . 
that 's not pedal board friendly in my opinion . 
nice as a tabletop affect . 
the footprint is fairly huge on the board at about 7.75 '' x 6.5 '' -lrb- approx -rrb- . 
the `` standard '' 9v center negative power supply is a `` postive '' -lrb- excuse my pun . -rrb- 
if you are looking for a way to play with signal modulation - echos , vibratos , reverbs , old style choruses ... this is not a bad way to get started playing with that . 
you can make a lot of sounds without breaking the bank.personally , i have other effects that make these sounds and do it in a smaller space , so for me ... not a keeper . 
your situation might be different than mine.not a bad product , acceptable at it 's price point , just did n't impress me much . 
it does not stick on to the guitar very well . 
trying some of the other reviews as to ways to get it to stick worked but i now have a small circle in the finish of my martin . 
i made mistake of attaching so wife could play rocksmith and now wish i had used cheaper guitar or better yet , bought a better pickup . 
i bought this to try out on my baritone uke.it works great and is very easy to use.i use it with my fender mustang.i had no problem with the suction cup accept on the rougher face of my martin dx1.i was able to attach it to the smoother hpl back and sides using the suction cup.i wet it before attaching.you could also use a small clamp , blue painters tape , etc. , for trouble mounting.it could be used on just about any instrument . 
some may need a clamp.it picks up anything it is attached to.it will feed back depending on how close and the angle to the amp.pretty cool.nice price . 
i know when i ordered it , i was buying a cheap device , and did n't expect it to be great . 
it works . 
that should be enough , but amazon requires a certain number of words . 
very authentic sound reproduction . 
simple to install but be aware that the instructions are not very clear . 
the threaded end is ` holed ' so you can hook it with a wire to pull it into position on the tailstock . 
you 'll never get your arm in there far enough . 
lolyou will need a 15/32nd drill bit to complete the install . 
so i decided to amplify my martin dreadnaught -lrb- a really , really nice acoustic guitar -rrb- . 
i did n't want to spend a lot if it just would n't sound good with a pickup , and saw this had consistently good ratings . 
i ca n't speak for other acoustic pickups , but this far exceeded my expectations , and i do n't plan on buying a more expensive piezo , or soundhole pickup.attaching itunfortunately the narrow portion of the barrel is not long enough to fit through the end/tail block ; and i did n't want to drill a new hole in my not-so-cheap guitar just to test out a relatively cheap pickup.so i attached the pickup in the regular position inside the body behind the bridge , and just ran the cable out from the sound hole . 
the jack is held onto the pickguard with some scotch outdoor mounting tape -lrb- which is kind of like really strong gum , it can be removed without leaving sticky residue -rrb- ; which holds it in place well enough to plug in a cable and move around as long as i do n't jerk the guitar quickly.sound qualityi plugged it into my cheap , regular guitar amp , and whoa ! 
the package mentions two locations you can place the pickup , and because i needed to run it through the sound hole , i could only place it where more treble is picked up . 
so i have to compensate on my amp by turning down the treble to 7 or lowerbecause the pickup is a transducer , no electrical feedback/interference is picked up , so the sound will be very clear and crisp . 
it would probably sound even better on an amp with better electric shielding ; the only noise i get even at max gain , max input volume , is from the amp itself , heard with every instrument i plug into it if i turn the master volume up too high.another thing to consider is that transducers pickup vibrations , so it wo n't pick up sound when placed a millimeter away from the guitar body , but will when touching it . 
so with that in mind , the pickup will strongly output every sound you make to the guitar body ; like it brushing up against your body , a zipper hitting the guitar , your fingers sliding on the strings etc. . 
i bought this as a cheap way to amplify my acoustic . 
learned my lesson . 
should of just forked over the money for an a/e . 
i have a yamaha f335 i really like . 
i say someone take a piezo transducer to amplify his guitar so i thought i 'd try it . 
i first picked up a transducer for about $ 3 and experimented . 
i like it , sounded good then i saw this from axl and i thought i 'd try it . 
installing it was n't bad accept i bought a set of drill bits i did n't need for $ 10 . 
so i got it installed and plugged it in and from the start the sound was alright . 
i just wanted it for playing around at home so i did n't need real great sound quality . 
but sound was ok accept it picks up every bang and knock especially my planet waves i think quick connect strap connector . 
my other complaint is i could n't turn it up too loud without the feedback screeching . 
overall product quality is good . 
setup was ok . 
price was good . 
sound in my opinion needs some tweaking . 
the fact that it is passive really kills it . 
i just could not get any sound out of it , i tried multiple placements . 
i finally just bought a guitar with a pickup in it . 
not worth the money , or the extra hole in your guitar . 
i have recently been itching to buy a classical guitar , as that 's what i learned on as a child . 
i ca n't afford it at the moment , so i decided to give these a shot.these do not turn your steel string into a classical guitar by any stretch of the imagination . 
i did n't expect them to - but a guy can dream , ca n't he?anyway , what they did provide was very warm and clear sound to my normally overly-bright takamine . 
it also helped with the rather high action . 
they play and sound softer . 
it 's almost like having a new guitar.during the stringing/stretching process i broke the g string -lrb- go easy , they are silk after all -rrb- and so had to use a standard bronze replacement . 
i asked my non-music oriented girlfriend if she could pick out the ` oddball ' string and she got it right on the first try . . 
that 's how much of a difference these strings make . 
they sound less ` metallic ' - that may sound obvious but my point is that it 's a big difference , enough for her untrained ears to hear.i 'm still saving up for a classical , but i really love these strings , and will be using them on my tak going forward . 
pack of 10 guitar picks - check `` meet the beatles '' theme - checkretail packaging - checktwo-day delivery -lrb- got it the next day ... thanks to prime -rrb- - checkhappy guitarist - checki ca n't really complain about anything , accept maybe for the price . 
but then again , i did n't have to buy these . 
they are fun and kitschy . 
5-stars . 
this was a gift for a friend who is a beatles fan . 
i bought him two different types he he liked them both . 
these will not be used much . 
if you use a medium pick for playing these are really cool picks to play with and about the same price as a fender or dunlop medium pick . 
for a beatles collector what a great price for a neat beatles product . 
even the packaging it cool.if you need picks for playing or a neat beatles product to collect you wo n't be dissipointed with this purchase.excellent product from a fantastic seller . 
this is my first noise reducer . 
it works and like it says it reduces the noise . 
it comes with 2 knobs and 1 switch . 
the switch let you choose if you want it to reduce the noise when is activated or to mute everything when activated . 
the 2 knobs , 1 of them let you select the range of the noise you want to reduce , the other one how fast you want it to start reducing the noise . 
i noticed a slight change of the original sound of my distortion , but it could be also because i did n't find the right setup . 
if the knob of the noise to reduce is on the highest setting , then it reduce also the sound of the all guitar , so you really got ta study this before you can use it properly . 
overall , for the price i 'm happy with it , and it hides the hiss and all the other sounds unwanted . 
i wanted a noise reducer because i have like 10 pedals and the loud feedback i was getting back through them was insane . 
i got this one because it wa cheaper and basically thinking why not ? 
it 's like $ 25 . 
it was a great choice . 
the pedal stops nearly all unwanted feedback and does n't altar your tone . 
it does take some time to figure it out but after that its golden . 
it 's great . 
- it 's simple to operate - it does what it 's made to do - it does that very well - it 's bargaintasticif you know what a noise gate is supposed to do and you think you might need one , then i highly recommend this unit.i 'm about to get a second one and put all my distortion-creating devices in the loop -lrb- other behringer units , rat , big muff , etc etc -rrb- . 
the one i already have can stay at the end of my signal chain , just before the delays . 
pretty much a must-have for recording , especially during those quiet spots :--rrb- thanks to this unit i have a very quiet recording setup . 
cleans up the hum , going in to effects pedals , some pedals make noise , some do n't as much with this it cleans them all.behringer all the way , you can keep your expensive boss pedals . 
this noise reducer pedal gets probably 90-95 % noise off , using heavy-noisy distortion pedals & has an amazing value .100 % recommended !!!! it does the job as described it though . 
i have no complains and the cheap price was a plus for me . 
i have a strat running into a crate amp with a tub preamp and it picked up noise like mad . 
this pedal is like an automatic volume knob that turns down the input if there is n't a signal from the guitar . 
takes a little playing with it to get it dialed in , but now i just keep it on all of the time . 
i already had two behringer stompboxes , and am thinking of adding a few more , so i thought rather than having a mess on the stage , i 'd get a pedalboard . 
i had n't really studied them too much , accept to note that they all seemed to be way more money than they were worth . 
then , recently i found this one for less than a hundred bucks , so i really could n't pass it up . 
i am very impressed with this unit . 
it is well made , well designed , and comes with all sorts of cords and accessories . 
nothing is lacking to start playing right away . 
i 'm not sure how easy other brands stompboxes will fit into this board -lrb- you may need to trim the foam that holds them in a little bit -rrb- , but i think the board should be pretty universal for whatever you have . 
i am not disappointed in the least . 
i think you will like this board . 
nice thumbpicks for banjo . 
they are size large , so if you generally have a very large hand they will be tight on you . 
i have a larger hand and they work well , but they are about a micrometer away from being too snug . 
but i like them a lot . 
would also work fine with acoustic guitar picking if that 's whay you 're into -lrb- though i always preferred acoustic picking without a thumbpick -rrb- . 
ordered these large picks and like others mentioned , they are not large at all . 
i have average size hands and thumbs and the pick initially numbed my thumb in about twenty seconds it was so tight . 
i solved the problem by simply holding a bic lighter flame about a half inch away from the heel of the pick for just about three seconds . 
i could feel the celluloid loosen up quickly . 
it was just a matter of pulling the pick open just a bit . 
it 's actually easy to completely customize the size and shape of the picks with just a few seconds of heat . 
the picks fit fine now , and i did n't even need to place &#34; foreign &#34; objects into the microwave to do it.any questions just feel free to ask and i will answer best i can . 
thanks.spo i 'd give this baby six stars if i could . 
my prior practice amp -lrb- a vox -rrb- was very nice , but finally went south and required replacement . 
i was looking for something with a great tube sound , as most of the solid-state amps that i 've used -lrb- mainly fenders and line6 stuff -rrb- just do n't get there . 
i was actually looking at the fender blues junior and headed to my local gc to check 'em out and listen side-by-side . 
the first time i plugged a strat into this guy in the store , i was blown away -lrb- and that was with all of the jimmy page wannabes cranking different amps all over the store -rrb- . 
i 've got ta say , part of me was hoping to rationalize the extra buck for a blues junior , but the bugera actually sounded better . 
the only one left in the store was the floor model , so i grabbed it.got it home and cranked it up and here are my observations : - it 's solid and heavy . 
it 's still a small-fry -lrb- slightly bigger than most 15w amps out there -rrb- , but much heavier . 
- the construction is great . 
i think i read some reviews that knocked the construction , but from the handle to the floor everything looks like it 's built to last . 
- the sound is even better at home -lrb- without the gc cacophony -rrb- - adjustments are minimal , but enough . 
the tone adjustment basically takes the tone from fat to sharp . 
i 've run my strat , tele and taylor t5 through this . 
i think the hard bodies get the best blues tone , but i can get a really nice clean tone from my t5 - the headphones sound great . 
i was really surprised by this . 
i would have thought you needed the speaker to get that great fat tube tone , but sounds awesome through a pair of good headphones - the price is self-explanatory , but that 's really the part that blew me away . 
this amp would sell for double the price tag . 
never has 15 watts sounded so loud and clear . 
never think it only hadan 8 inch speaker . 
just enough effects to leave your pedals at home for practices.light weight easy to carry . 
i just bought this amp for my epiphone goth studio guitar , i 've got it this weekend and i 'm very satisfied with this product . 
i 'm not a proffessional but this amp is really good for the price you pay as it comes with so many functions , with complete add-ons on th webpage . 
solid , nice sound , very good quality to make anyone happy , accept your neighbors.now after a couple of months i want to say ... this is great product in terms of sound , not so great in terms of small building detailsgreat for blues style , just use it with clean and good reverb or crunch and you will get amazing blues sounds.my only con and that 's why i have reduced it to 4 stars is the fact that one of the corners protectors came broken and also , the phones are not working . 
better quality control at the plant can avoid this things to happen . 
i wrote to line6 and i got useless answers about . 
i 've been playing rock and blues for over 40 years . 
i 've owned a number of amps over the years including a 1960s ampeg 40 watt combo , and a pre-cbs 100 watt fender showman , and my latest , a crate 5212 50 watt tube amp that i bought about 10 years ago . 
i also have a small peavy 50 watt solid state combo . 
the crate has always sounded great , and it 's what i use exclusively in my basement studio , but it weighs a ton and the clean channel has always had a habit of fading in and out -lrb- despite numerous repair attempts -rrb- , so i 've been using the peavy when i play out . 
the last time i did , i was really unsatisfied with the sound and decided to look for something else . 
i own a line6 pocket pod and love it so i looked into the line6 amps.when i found that i could get a 75 watt modeling amp with a looper and a more presets than i could go through in a lifetime for less than $ 300 , i ordered one from amazon , sight unseen and unheard . 
out of the box i was amazed at just about everything . 
the clean amp models are crisp and clear , the dirty ones thick and rich . 
the effects that i have played around with so far are amazing , and i can not detect any difference between them and my digital delay , phaser and overdrive pedals that cost about the same as the whole spider iv 75 . 
and the thing is loud ! 
very loud . 
as i get more experience with the amp , i 'm sure that i 'm going to want to tweak the built in presets to my taste , but even right out of the box the sound is pretty awesome.i 'm sure that a lot of pro purists out there would laugh at the idea of a 75 watt solid state combo with 1 12 '' speaker as their main amp , and if you 've got $ 1800 to spend and a roadie , i guess they 'd be right . 
but for the money , the sound , the size and the very light weight -lrb- 36 lbs -rrb- alone make this a fabulous deal . 
add in the modeling and the effects -lrb- high quality individual floor pedals or rack devices to replicate these effects could cost thousands of dollars just by themselves -rrb- , and compared to my $ 750 crate vc5212 , at $ 300 the spider iv 75 seems like an almost impossibly large gain in overall function . 
i doubt that i will use my crate again -lrb- accept when guests come to jam -rrb- . 
and then the less than good ... it does n't come with a foot switch . 
you have to buy one if you want to be able to use the looping in any realistic way and/or take advantage of the 4 channels on the fly , and to upload new firmware to the amp . 
and of course you really want to do all if that -lrb- and more -rrb- , so a foot controller is essential . 
i opted for the fbv express mk ii , the smallest and least expensive model with a pedal . 
it lets me access all 4 channels as well as the looper and acts as a volume/wah controller . 
it was another $ 100 . 
it is really essential , so in my mind the price of the spider iv 75 is really just under $ 400 . 
and it does n't come with any manuals to speak of . 
all the manuals are available online for free , but of course you have to download them and print them . 
and these manuals are essential to access all but the most basic functions of the amp . 
if you do not have access to a computer and a printer -lrb- i guess there are some people somewhere in the world who do not -rrb- , i guess you 're sol . 
the `` advanced guide '' is the essential one for using the amp , and is only 3 pages long . 
that 's too short to explain everything you need to know in enough detail , and it 's not particularly well-written . 
there'a another manual for using the free downloadable software that lets you edit the presets at a low level that is another 21 pages long . 
i have not explored it much yet , but i suspect that it will be written similarly . 
once again , if you do not have a computer with an internet connection , there is a bunch of stuff that it is possible to do with the spider iv 75 that you will not be able to do.my guess is that it would have probably added $ 150 to the list price of the amp for line6 to have included a pedal and hard copies of the manual , and at $ 450 , the amp would seem less attractive to many , so line6 opted to handle things the way they did . 
bottom line is still that this is still an unbeatable deal.very highly recommended.jm tepper i started two years ago with a 15 watt spider iii , then along with other amps , bought a spider jam . 
i thought they were all great . 
now they come out with spider iv , and the difference in the sound is dramatic . 
they are getting very , very close to tube sound . 
so much so that for the lousy $ 299 , compared to say $ 1000 + for 75 watts of tube , this is a real steal.loaded with features , and hundreds of presets , it has something for everyone . 
the pitch shifter and 18 available manual settings just add to the fun . 
and it will work with either generation of fbv pedalboard . 
says so right in the manual . 
the only difference i see is with the generation ii pedal you get a usb port.does it sound as creamy and smooth as my peavey delta blues or crate palomino tube units ? 
no , there is still a little digital overlay around in there . 
but most people who are looking for a great home based amp , or maybe a church or small gig amp , this is a winner and the price is just nuts . 
forget the peavy vyper , this is hands down much better and you do n't have to sink another couple hundred in a pedal to get to all the presets like the vyper . 
this thing works wonders . 
if you are anyone who performs live or just someone who happens to switch between channels alot i recommend . 
i hate having to let go of the guitar to switch channels , and this just is perfect for the job . 
the pedals are all easy to press and i love the volume/wah 2-in-1 pedal . 
i just use it as a volume , because i already have a wah pedal . 
the tuner works amazing as well . 
i also love the fact that it connects to your amp via rj45 ethernet cable . 
i used this on my recent stratocaster build and the gold looks awesome . 
it was easy to install and the finish was perfect . 
when you are upgrading your fender to a gold package nothing completes the upgrade like a gold fender jack plate . 
in the beginning i had problems . 
however i have a classical guitar and i may have been hitting dual strings accidently at first . 
after several days , i felt much better about it . 
i 'm pretty new to this so i take the blame . 
unless you tune to only standard tunings this thing is garbage ! 
i tune my hellraiser to d then drop to c and it will not register . 
the needle either flops around constantly or just does not display the proper notes . 
i just recently started up learning guitar.this tuner has already paid for itself in checking that my guitar is in tune , great device !!! 
one of the best & accurate tuners that i have ever used . 
i have been playing guitar for 45 years & at this size & accuracy , you can not beat this handy tuner . 
fits in most guitar cases & is lightweight . 
a good tool to have for a guitar players bag of tricks . 
i have at least 5 of these . 
i like the small footprint , plus it collapses for flat storage or transport . 
holds acoustic or electric . 
good quality , stable , economical . 
i have read that the foam padding can react with nitrocellulose lacquer and mar the instruments finish . 
i have n't seen that on my older stands , but to error on the side of caution , i have glued thin leather to the back and lower support of the stands . 
it is working fine . 
i bought the first about 10 years ago . 
it is still like new . 
it tunes my ukuleles ! 
it tunes my guitar ! 
i can even see how close my voice is to being on pitch ! 
hooray for this tuner . 
i bought one of these about a year ago and i am going to buy a second one to keep in my gutar case as a back-up . 
great tuner , just clip it on the headstock , turn it on and tune -- display changes to bright green when you are exactly in tune so i can even do it without my glasses on . 
i have used it in noisy environments -lrb- other instruments tuning or playing -rrb- and it still works , never had a problem with it picking up tuning informatiom clipped to the headstock of either my acoustic guitar or fender stratocastor.the only thing that could use improvement is the auto-off function ; mine has failed to detect an extended duration of no audio energy and as such , stayed turned on until it drained the battery . 
after that , i got in the habit of making sure i turned it off when not in use . 
and it uses commonly found 2032 cell batteries so not a big deal to replace -lrb- just grab a two-pack of them at the grocery store to keep on hand -rrb- . 
overall , very useful , accurate device and worth a few extra dollars . 
this pad is great for midi vsti 's , drums , queuing , and it 's got great action ! 
works great with ableton , reason , fl studio , cantabile performer and a whole bunch more daws and hosts.the software is a little lame and does n't always work properly ... but you do n't really need it that much anyways ... so it 's whatever . . 
this product has almost zero documentation in the box or on the akai pro website . 
technical support is also almost zero . 
akai seems to not care about getting new users up to speed on their products . 
customer service is basically `` if you have to ask , you should not buy this '' . 
i asked the akai technical department which sequencer software i needed and they told me to go to a music store ! 
this may sound stupid but unless you have a lot of midi knowledge and experience do n't buy this product . 
try finding a midi tutorial that is usable . 
good luck with that chore.added 08nov2010 : the keyboard arrived with one of the bottom rubber footpads missing . 
i sent an email to akai asking for a replacement but they do not have any parts . 
i find that unbelievable . 
this will give you the delay and compression that you need for country twang on the telecaster . 
it will also give you a rhythm track to play along too . 
the rhythm machine has 44 rhythms with adjustable volume and tempo . 
it is not perfect as it has no on/off switch , it reverts to default mode when you power it up , it is a little hard to set volume and tempo on drum beats . 
it only cost around $ 60 so perfection should not be expected . 
for practice and the home studio it is great . 
as usual an excellent zoom product.adds to my playing . 
just love this thing . 
not too difficult to get the hang of . 
even for me . 
the effects are good but the controls and setups are clumsy and kind of annoying and after a while i just could n't live with it . 
its just a basick thin leather strap , my only problem with it is it could be longer my bass sits to high with this strap set at its longest setting what can you say about something that you need but is really insignificant in the scheme of things . 
i needed it and it works simple as that this is a good item and has served me well . 
however i just upgraded to an intellitouch pt10 for a bit more money and its a much more convenient and really easy to use . 
the korg runs off of ambient sound and gets interference from background noise while the intellitouch is a clip on and uses vibration to ` hear ' the note . 
i only have used this tuner on classical guitars -lrb- the ones with nylon strings -rrb- . 
i teach classical guitar and have had the opportunity to use it on many different classical guitars of varying quality . 
it has tuned them all very well . 
a great advantage i 've found using this tuner -lrb- tune tech tt500 -rrb- verses tuners which use a microphone , is that i can now talk with my students while tuning and no longer have to ask them to please be quiet while i tune their guitars . 
kids especially like to talk and now i can fully engage in conversation with them while tuning their guitars . 
the only problem i 've noticed , and thus only 4 stars , is that i usually have to begin tuning with any string other than the low e string . 
for some reason , the tuner seems to have trouble sensing the low e vibrations and the needle will not move . 
this problem has always resolved itself when i tune another string and then tune the low e.pros :1 . 
pitch is registered quickly with minimal needle fluctuations2 . 
ambient noise does not disturb tuning sensor3 . 
small and compact4 . 
swivel head for ease of viewing the screen .5 . 
the screen is very bright and is also easily seen in direct sunlight .6 . 
rubber feet on clamp will not scratch guitar7 . 
clamp is strong and will open wide but easy to squeeze open with fingers .8 . 
being a chromatic tuner means you are not stuck just tuning eadgbe . 
it 's tuning range is 12 note . 
a2 - b7 .9 . 
will automatically turn itself off after 3 minutes of non-use . 
cons :1 . 
delay on tuning low e string2 . 
buttons rattle while tuning 2nd string , b. 3 . 
plastic on screen scratches easilyi do n't yet know how long the button battery will last or how much battery replacements cost . 
i will update this review when i have that information . 
but for now , i am very pleased with this tuner . 
i have owned many electronic tuners and this one so far beats them all . 
i have also used it to tune my guitarlele and it tunes it darn near perfectly ! 
great chromatic tuner at a great price - i love it ! 
this does work as described . 
it arrives without any instructions whatsoever but its fairly obvious to figure out . 
the reason i only gave it two stars however is because i find it so uncomfortable ! 
its quite hard on your collarbone . 
i have added foam to it and now it works well , but i suspect one might be better just buying a foam one in the first place . 
everest ez series shoulder rest for 4/4 violin is very good deal , if you are learning to play a violin.it helps you to keep the violin in right position all the time . 
i am extremely happy with this product . 
i own several shoulder rests , and this quickly became my favorite and stays on my favorite violin . 
i have no problem whatsoever keeping it on the violin as long as it 's in the proper position . 
the adjustability is a key factor , and i can turn one side low and the other side higher for a highly customized fit . 
the padding is also excellent and comfortable . 
a top-quality product . 
bottom line up front : the mxr fullbore metal is a high-octane distortion suitable for modern metal music . 
it 's 3-band eq with adjustable midrange q gives the mxr fm the ability to model virtually every other distortion out there.what i like about the pedal is that it 's small , easy to operate , and does n't take much time to dial in the tone you want . 
i play with a marshall jcm2000 dsl50 going into a 1960a 4x12 using a les paul standard , and it sounds amazing . 
i love the onboard marshall jcm-flavored tube distortion , but it is more in line with the new wave of british heavy metal -lrb- obviously -rrb- , and not entirely suitable for modern american metalcore . 
the mxr fullbore metal gets me to where i need to go . 
this is nice because i can use my amp to have a good clean and overdrive channel , and then tap the fullbore when i need to play metal.what i dislike is that this pedal generates a lot of white noise , so you have to be careful with the treble and mid-q knobs . 
however i also noticed that the amount of white noise also depended on my amp 's eq settings as well , so know in advance you 'll need to spend a good 15-minutes doing a proper setup for recording purposes.what about the eh metal muff ? 
i owned a metal muff for years , and this pedal totally blows it away . 
the big &#34; selling point &#34; about the mm is that it has a top boost . 
big deal . 
i wrote a review for the mm on amazon , but in summary , the top boost makes everything sound weird and unmusical . 
comparing the top boost to the noise gate in terms of the big &#34; selling point &#34; , the fullbore 's noise gate -lrb- which has adjustable sensitivity -rrb- to me seems like a much better feature when thinking about how tight you want your rhythm guitar or leads to sound.what about the boss me-70 ? 
i currently own an me-70 , and being totally honest - i think the negative peer pressure and crap guitarist 's give each other about multi-effects is because in their mind they think an old-fashioned pedalboard with a thousand bucks worth of pedals is &#34; real &#34; whereas multi-effects pedals are &#34; fake &#34; . 
this might be true to some extent , but modern digital modeling is getting so close to vintage analog signal chains ... that at some point the trade-off does indeed make sense . 
-lrb- fyi : dave mustaine uses a digitech gsp1101 as part of his live rig -rrb- . 
#endrant . 
anyway , the boss me-70 has only a few settings useful onstage , but not so much for recording since in the end , they do sound a tad digital , and the me-70 compresses your signal . 
the mxr fullbore does not compress , and sounds analog , so it wins.for recording purposes ? 
i bought this pedal because i wanted a dedicated metal distortion to use for my metal ep i 'm self-recording . 
in conjunction with an ada gcs-3 , i created an all-analog signal chain for direct interface that sounds amazing . 
check out the ada gcs-3 if you can . 
it 's an amazing speaker simulator , and it can take any pedal you throw at it and convert it into a beautifully sounding emulation as if the pedal itself was it 's own 1x12 combo amplifier . 
anyway , through the gcs-3 , the fullbore basically sounds like a mesa-boogie . 
why only 4 stars ? 
the fullbore is n't for everybody , it is n't for every guitar , or every amp , but by itself , it 's really friggin good . 
i suppose if it had a 10-band eq and a 12ax7 preamp circuit , it would be &#34; the best metal pedal &#34; , but for a small piece of gear , it 's probably the best analog distortion on the market . 
best distortion i ever used . 
it took me a while but i finally got that preriphery / protest the hero tone with this plus my overdrive does it 's job extremely well , produces high quality audio and is fantastic for recording your microphone or guitar or what have you without any fuzz or latency . 
it 's built like a tank , and it 's nice and solid . 
this interface is an amazing piece of beginner kit that will not disappoint . 
this was my first foray into home recording and it comes with audacityfor free . 
free is free , and you get what you pay for in terms of something that will not produce high qualty musical reproduction . 
the interface is noisy , and it requred a lot of tweaking after the fact to get a reasonable sound without distorion and humms etc. . 
sent it back after one day . 
well , i do n't really know what else to say . . 
i ordered them for the guitar , though i wo n't be using them for the banjo . 
-lrb- i prefer the sound of clawhammer banjo -rrb- the thumb picks fit my thumb perfectly , and the finger picks only needed a tiny squeeze to stay put . 
they feel kind of alien right now , as it 's the first time i 've ever wore finger picks , but i 'll get used to them eventually :p . 
i just started playing banjo and did not want to wrap up tons of money in supplies . 
this was a perfect `` kit '' if you will giving you everything you need to start at a great price . 
i just started learning the banjo and the picks are worth it . 
they really help me out and they are a cheap price . 
this hand full of picks saves your fingernails , they are not the best , but easy to fit to the fingertips though the thumb picks that came are not the size i am used to . 
practical , useful for drum kit . 
tilts to match personal requirement . 
fits easily onto cymbal stand and , importantly , holds in place during performances . 
prof mike haller i 've been in professional broadcast studios that do n't have mics as nice as this one . 
good flat response , but you can also click the bass roll off and get a little cleaner voice if you do n't like to eq after the fact . 
sounds like a million bucks . 
a booster makes your signal louder ! 
that has been the case with all the clean boosters on the market like mxr micro amp , ehx lpb-1 , bbe boosta grande , modtone , etc. . 
they keep your guitar 's original tone , make it louder and when pushed enough , will add a good amount of gain & grit . 
but there is something else going on with the xotic ep booster . 
yes , it also makes the signal louder , adds gain or a little dirt , but also makes your overall sound bigger & wider ! 
based on vintage echoplex units used by guitar heroes like jimmy page , duane allman , gary moore , etc. . 
this pedal is really small in size , has one knob & the footswitch . 
it does have an internal dip switch . 
you open up the back of the pedal & choose you own setting . 
i leave at the classic setting , turn the gain knob at 9 or 10 o'clock & leave it on all the time . 
i tried it before & after my od pedals and my personal preference is `` after '' ! 
being in front of the amp , it did n't do much when i tried to use just the dirt channel on my tube amp . 
i put it in the fx loop & it boosted the signal alright but i did n't like it as much as in front of the amp boosting my od pedals.this is one pedal that will stay on my board . 
i does n't take up much space , built to last and will make anything you throw before it sound better . 
it does one job only but it does it so well ! 
indeed , this little blue-lighted wonder will make you famous . 
not unlike the &#34; three wolf moon &#34; shirt , this little pedal will get you the ladies -lrb- or if you 're a lady , it will likely get you the guys -rrb- . 
either way , it gets you what you want ! 
on top of that , it does a great job of boosting your signal from your guitar and getting you just a bit of &#34; oomph &#34; . 
in particular , i find it helpful when i 'm running a lower output guitar through a long cable . 
did i mention it has a blue light ? 
the only downside is that you have to open up the back -lrb- with a screwdriver , so put that on your shopping list if you do n't have one -rrb- to adjust the little switches that chance the tone . 
now it does n't work -lrb- same day i got it -rrb- . 
in my control panel the mic is there but it does n't pick up any sound . 
followed all the instructions , emailed blue support and at first the person was quick to reply but now its been 3-4 days no answer . 
maybe i 'm being impatient but the mic only worked for a couple hours since i got it ... if you guys know of any good alternatives please leave a comment . 
this mic fits my studio need perfectly . 
it 's usb connection works great for my voice overs with great sound and sensitivity . 
i would recommend one this microphone in just a few words is awesome . 
the sound recorded by this device in all modes left nothing to be desired for me . 
i use this mic for voice over work that gets added to videos playing in major hotel rooms . 
superior mic ! 
this was an excellent purchase . 
beside having a great range of audio pick-up , the mic is so versatile . 
great product ! 
in case you were wondering , this is a clone of the boss compressor/sustainer . 
it does a very good job reproducing the original at a fraction of the cost . 
you add noise to your chain with any compressor because that 's what they do - they elevate quiet signal and minimize volume spikes to even it all out . 
when it is off , this thing had pretty decent bypass but i would not string an entire board together with pedals that are not true bypass because it would suck tone . 
the box is plastic , but it is solid abs plastic and is perfectly adequate . 
i 've not yet heard of a behringer stomp box failing because the plastic box crushed when someone stepped on it . 
people do like to complain about the battery cover being annoying and i have to say - are n't they all ??? seriously - when you can hook up a daisy chain and not ever have to deal with a dead battery ever again in your life , what are you complaining about ? 
the knobs are solid , and work just fine . 
i own like a dozen of these cheap behringer pedals and i have never had a problem with any of them . 
you get more than the asking price worth of function out of this box . 
i bought this pedal mainly for compressing the bass guitar in my home studio . 
it does what it is supposed to . 
i 'm no master of compression , but i get a very usable , controlled signal from it . 
i noticed some hum when i turned the level up pretty high and that should be expected . 
i paid less than $ 30 for this pedal and that should be a factor when you 're considering durability of this pedal.my bass player uses this pedal going into an svt classic . 
no noticeable hum at &#34; concert &#34; level.yes , this pedal is made of high strength plastic . 
if you are an angry stomper , go elsewhere . 
this pedal will not survive your overzealous foot.battery changing ... yes , it 's a pain in the butt . 
two pens are required to push in the hinge pins to release the battery cover -lrb- the footswitch , itself -rrb- . 
i bought a power supply , never looked back.so if you are on a budget , or not one of the lucky ones with an endorsement deal with a boutique pedal co. , this should do well for you . 
this behringer compressor sustainer compare 's to the boss cs-2 the behringer sustaining is excellent and a tone , compression level is very good and all for $ 25.00 , not putting down the boss , but for this price you ca n't go wrong . 
more likely known as a guitar compensation device , the affect itself it widely used in everything . 
i have couple few behringer pedals , some complain about plastic housings but a -rrb- i do n't beat my gear and b -rrb- plastic does n't get rust and corrosion . 
the build on behringer are tough and fine to me , and the prices make them attainable to all players . 
the only thing i say negative is all that battery junk inherent to all pedals , got ta spring for power supply plug , if not now , eventually because it 'll drive you nuts.compressor is inherent to quack and pop of chickinpickin and country stuff you just ca n't not have if that 's your thing . 
the sustainer is just that adds sustain to any guitar regardless of build , so even a cheap one can ring like the best.so you got both in one , tailoring will add life to even a dull axe . 
some put down effects for whatever reason but this one likely adds tones that you ca n't do without once you find em . 
behringer makes a lot of electronics for guitar and bass . 
i have an fcb10 that i use and like , great controller for the price . 
the cs400 at roughly 20.00 is a decent pedal that will ` get the job done ' . 
is it equivalent to a boss , dynacomp , visual sound or keeley compressor ... nope . 
you will get 20.00 worth of use out of it though for sure . 
the housing is pretty flimsey and when you change the battery its a pita . 
just do n't take a flying leap to stomp on it and battery consumption is really low so with a lot of use you may have to change the battery once or twice a year . 
good pedal for the beginner at an unbeatable price point . 
and nice its like really just wow ! 
you know ? 
like awesome and really cool i do i do ido like like love it to test i installed one pad and left the original pad on the other side of my 440 's . 
the 840 pad has a larger surface area -lrb- see my pics with the old pad on the left in all shots -rrb- so i guess that spreads out the pressure over a larger area . 
but it 's really minimal and i did not notice a huge difference pressure wise . 
the material is nicer/softer than the original so that is a plus . 
every so often i would flip the headphones around to see if i could tell anything . 
the larger pad does cover more of the ear - almost surrounds it . 
but seriously , if you had me blindfolded i would n't bet my life that i always knew which side were which . 
but in general the large pad and softer material seems to be a better set up . 
i ca n't imagine any set of cans actually feeling comfortable to have on for an extended period of time.sound difference ? 
yes , one side in my test sounded better i felt ... until i switched them around ! 
just like eyes your two ears are not 100 % equal and over time they lose their edge but not at equal rates . 
i think those who make any kind of big deal out of any significant improvement or degradation in sound might be imagining it . 
i would have to see some measureable proof to believe that whatever millimeters ' worth of difference in how the drivers may sit in relationship to your eardrums affects how the sound waves actually strike them . 
wishful thinking or all inside their heads maybe ? 
notice the contradictory reviews - more bassy , less bassy etc ??? it becomes highly subjective and i would n't buy or not buy these pads based upon those claims . 
if you need replacements this is no brainer as a cheap way to keep your expensive headphones alive . 
if you need more comfort then these may do the trick for you but i 'm glad i did n't pay any more for them than i did from amazon . 
that 's my 2 cents . 
brass tacks : they are velour . 
they fit on the ath-m50 headphones . 
that is what i wanted.they are not a perfect fit , as they are meant for a slightly larger can , but it 's more than snug . 
looks good too ! 
-lrb- remember : because of the material , you will notice a slight difference in sound . -rrb- 
i wanted an upgrade to my tu-2 , which i had for years . 
this tu-3 is easier to see , and is more precise in it 's tunings . 
i recommend it ! 
as with all boss products , i 've been very happy . 
the tuner is easy to use ... need i say more . 
i 'm from the olden days of the 440 tuning fork for tuning , so this is great ! 
i had done a fair amount of research on banjos before i bought this . 
it has many of the same components of a more expensive banjo and plays very well . 
yes there many banjos and some with more frills . 
there is no indication of where this banjo was made , but the quality is top notch . 
i am a woodworker and judge workmanship closely . 
i see no flaws on my banjo . 
i did not have the problem with the 5th string machine being to tight as others . 
i bought mine from -lsb- ... -rsb- , the same place it ships if you buy it at amazon best was 10 bucks cheaper with free shipping . 
if i could give it more than 5 stars i would . 
i can play a guitar and learning a few banjo chords was easy . 
i also have very large hands with chubby fingers and was worried about it having a small neck , that is not a issue either . 
while i am expert on banjo i would gladly buy another and see no reason to spend more money at this point and probably not later on either . 
a keeper for sure . 
i purchesed this banjo for my personal hoby and it turned out to be a beautiful instrament the quality is great and the playability is great also , i am a guitar player for over 35 years and i know quality when i see it . 
for the money you ca n't beat the price i would recomend this bangjo for beginners , or just ony one who plays john r boy , was i surprised and pleased when the banjo arrived and i took my first look at my new purchase ! 
the instrument is far superior than i would have imagined for the price i paid for it.the workmanship and quality of the finish is really fine . 
i . 
recommend it without hesitation to anyone who wants good value for their money . 
the package was really well don e and arrived in good time . 
i have n't learned to play the banjo yet , but have played ukuleles , guitar , tipple , and lute so i know a good instrument when i see it . . 
i have been online shopping banjos quite ... extensively . 
ebay , amazon , 3 dozen + online shops , reviews from multitude of sources , investigating manufacturer home sites , etc. . 
i did the same for this banjo , and although there is actually very little out there about this particular banjo , i still felt very comfortable with what little i put together information wise . 
and frankly , at this price , it gets my warmest recommendation for those on a tight budget -lrb- sometimes , you just ca n't afford 400 + dollars for a mainstream name beginner brand -rrb- . 
additionally , mine came very well setup from the seller -lrb- aside from the inevitable tuning -rrb- . 
and its purty too ! 
i would also deeply recommendsnark sn-2 all instrument clip-on chromatic tuner ... absolutely the best tuner i have ever used and makes the various banjo-tuning schemes a breeze.be aware , in order to avoid possible confusion , jameson guitars is actually a sub-brand of davison guitars , so if you order and look at your peg-head and it says davison -lrb- like mine does -rrb- and not r.w. jameson , its the same maker -lrb- yes , i examined davison 's home site as well as the amazon seller 's -rrb- . 
this pedal is very exactly and had a tune all the string quickly . 
it was a good purchase . 
i recomend it . 
i finally purchased this in line tuner to replace my hand held cheap tuner . 
this thing is way more accurate than my old tuner and because it is true bypass it does n't suck any of your tone . 
i have n't used the battery pack , so do n't know about battery life . 
i use a one-spot plug to power it . 
another nice feature is you can set it to turn off the volume when in use or leave volume on . 
it 's very heavy and seems sturdy and well built . 
the display is a little confusing at first , but once i read the manual it makes good sense and is easy to use . 
i normally tune to drop f on my 8 string , but even in standard , i just cant stand the strobe , and theres no other mode . 
i ordered a pitch black for $ 70 . 
im still waiting on the return for this . 
as a musician for over four decades i 've owned a number of tuners as the technology progressed . 
my primary instrument is electric bass . 
this is the finest piece of equipment i 've ever purchased and used , and it has helped me solve a ` mysterious ' tuning phenomenon all players apparently face without knowing it . 
i 'll explain . 
but first , some details about the tuner ... : it 's construction is extremely solid , and it 's heft gives it stability . 
when you place it on a surface -lrb- top of your amp , floor , your knee ... . 
it stays there ! -rrb- . 
secondly , the large backlit display is very easy to read in all lighting conditions , ... no guessing . 
and thirdly , it is extremely sensitive and accurate , which brings me to my explanation of the ` mysterious tuning phenomenon . 
at issue is the inability of inexpensive tuners to properly identify frequencies/tones when setting string intonation at the octave fret . 
i 've been using $ 25 to $ 40 tuners -lrb- boss , korg , etc -rrb- over the past few years that would indicate a string is in tune , both for open string and octave . 
but , when simultaneously plucking an ` f ' note on the ` a ' string , and an ` f ' note high up on the ` g ' string my ear would percieve that they just were n't in tune ... the cycles were n't matching . 
so , that meant my inexpensive tuner was n't nearly discriminating enough . 
once i began using this strobe tuner , it clearly showed me -lrb- with proper accuracy -rrb- graphically what my ear was trying to tell me . 
after setting intonation according to the strobe tuner my bass now ` performs ' as it should through the range of notes/frets over the length of the neck . 
i guess another way of explaining it would be to say that it 's like having a gps that is accurate enough to get you to the right neighborhood , versus one that can get you to the right house . 
for the money , i feel i 've done myself a good turn by purchasing this strobe tuner . 
i 'm satisfied . 
i still keep one of my inexpensive tuners in my guitar case as it has a built in microphone and can be used by an accoustic guitar player if i 'm jamming with somebody . 
this strobe tuner is ` cable input ' only ... no mic , runs on a 9v battery with connectors for a power supply -lrb- sold separately -rrb- . 
my only ` complaint ' with this device is the battery connector . 
it 's the typical type that ` plugs ' in to the top of your 9v battery with two wires leading to the internals . 
i hate them as a rule . 
i would prefer solid contact points and a compartment where you would simply insert the battery , just like inserting any other battery type -lrb- aa , aaa , c , etc -rrb- . 
every issue i had was ironed out by mackie support.they are seriously fabulous.i 'm using this for a simple weigh station between my daw and my tascam 16 track.so far , no problems at all . 
i first bought the yamaha mg102c mixer , but it arrived defective so i returned and bought this instead.first impression of profx8 is very good . 
it 's a lot more durable/heavy than the mg102c , and the knobs are constructed much better.for example , all the knobs that have centering dent on mg102c does n't line up well , some are off by a few degrees . 
but on this profx8 every dented knob line up beautifully pointing up . 
knob turning pressure is also consistent and firm.really like the eq on the main output . 
as well as mute on every channel . 
build-in fx effects are okay , you have to turn fx knob all the way up to feel anything.when using usb to do recording -lrb- with audacity -rrb- there is noticeable buzz sound along side any recording , regardless if microphone channel is turned off or not.microphone preamp is so-so i guess . 
i have a akg d5 and sm58 , with both mics i have to turn gain and channel volume to 90 % to get a decent output.but it does the function perfectly . 
runs a little bit on the hot side . 
power cable is kinda short , so you may want to look for a longer one . 
i could not be happier ... excellent sound , easy controls , very responsive and is better than advertised . 
the effects are excellent , and feel and quality of parts are wonderful . 
buy it . 
by now , you have probably read about the problem with the usb connection generating a high pitch sound during recording making the usb functionality unusable -lrb- an amazon reviewer referred to this as a `` fatal flaw , '' and i heartily agree -rrb- . 
i experienced this firsthand , then read folks struggling with the issue on the mackie support blogs . 
when i called mackie support to seek a fix , i was told that the problem was well known and the newer lots had been corrected with new hardware . 
they sent me a new mackie board from the newer lots , and i returned my old one . 
i have not had any problems with the usb functionality since . 
i am thankful to mackie for the great customer service , especially since i addressed the problem after the one year warranty had expired.i 'm assuming that purchases made now will not have the problem , but if it does , contact mackie to get a replacement.at this point , i am still running the board through its paces , but thus far so good . 
i was unaware when i originally purchased these that there was a threaded mic mount on the back extension pole . 
i already had a couple 13 '' posi-lok boom arms that i popped on them and was able to reclaim two floor mic stands and save a little bit more floor space . 
they are fairly well constructed for the price and fit perfectly in my small home studio . 
the mics are now perfectly positioned and dont get kicked around anymore . 
the reason i stopped using amp stands was because i could n't find anything collapsible and non-bulky . 
it works very well and is very sturdy ... i use it for a hot rod deluxe . 
as a musician i wanted both a pa and an instrument amp , but i also wanted extra inputs and outputs . 
this has it all . 
whether you want to output to a pa or from a pa. ... . 
to your guitar amp or from it ... and even play your mp3 player while you play and sing . 
if you need more inputs , then just output a mixer to it . 
the tone controls are nice and the bass you can get is quite amazing for a 5.5 '' speaker . 
link to a bass amp or sub-woofer and you definitely have full sound . 
certainly loud enough for a 1-man-band gig and definitely enough to supply an outdoor party with some music . 
i know it 's a copy of other speaker/amps ... but its a behringer . 
i think it 's a wonderful and adequate must-have for any musician . 
so i originally got the virtually identical mackie version of this and it crapped out on me after a couple of years of easy work . 
behringer is typically good at making comparable gear at better prices than most . 
i use this for my vocal monitor attached to my drum rack . 
so much more efficient than a floor monitor . 
i have my own volume and tone settings at my fingertips , and because there is more than one channel , i can run a full main mix into it on one channel and mix in a separate feed from my own pa channel . 
very cool to be able to mix down a too loud harmony , or turn myself up a little in my ear without affecting any of the other mix dynamics . 
definitely recommend ... hey you get volume and tone and control of your own space ! 
both of the stands had parts that had fallen out , or were missing all together . 
when the pamphlet that comes with them states that they are fully assembled and guaranteed to be free of defects , this is a major concern . 
it may be that i got a bad box that got missed by quality control , but it does make me suspicious of pyle products . 
it 's a great strap . 
it 's comfortable and you can wear it for hours . 
it looks good as while . 
i got it earlier then expected and i love it . 
i would definitely recommend it for anyone from beginner to pro . 
this will work for just about everyone ... but i prefer the walker williams brand ... but these work fine easy to get strap locks on ... will keep on the side for next guitar ... you shouild be happy . 
enjoy i can use this strap with either smooth or suede side on my shoulder.actually i like the smooth side on my shoulder so it is easy to adjust position without pulling on my shirt . 
its a little stiff and i 'm sure it will soften up upon more use . 
cant beat the price ! 
i used this on an acoustic bass and it is plenty long . 
great leather strap nice color well made strong and feels comfortable smooth , it wont dig in ur shoulder like some other straps out there , , , and u can adjust it , , i adjust mines and cut the unnecessary material , , can am lee and tall so i have no gut to have to need extra strap and i do n't like to play low like to my knees , that looks trashy and cant shred cuz of the angle of ur wrist , so i use my strap waist height and looks cool proportional and it gives me a great angle for my wrist , to be able to play fast and move up n down on the neck , , , so i say great buy , , i give it 5 stars . 
i thought i would not have a problem with the length of the strap but low and behold it was just a little too short . 
i like my guitar hanging low and this strap does n't cut it in that department . 
still , for the price i had to give it four stars . 
you get a lot of high quality leather at a very good price , just wish it went a little longer . 
if you 're looking for an inexpensive leather strap , this one will do nicely . 
leather is supple , not hard , and it looks great with natural finish guitars . 
my only complaint is that it is difficult to attach at first -lrb- holes are smaller than usual , probably an anomaly -rrb- . 
so for the price of polypropylene or cotton , you can upgrade to leather . 
it works well for holding up a guitar , and it looks good doing it . 
as long as you do n't ask it to hold up a bass , you 'll be fine -lrb- the price is hard to beat too -rrb- . 
my kid is happy with this strap for his guitar . 
he did have to widen the hole a bit in order to fit the strap over the peg on the bottom of his guitar , but ever since he got it on he 's been very pleased . 
he especially likes the colors . 
it looks nice , it 's really really long and it 's made strong but you could also use it for slicing skin and maybe a whip . 
after throwing it into the washing machine 3x with lots of softener , rubbing it with lard , dirt and baby powder , then soaking it over night . 
it 's finally soft and i could play naked without slicing off my head ! 
so buy it and prepare to really abuse it for a few days to soften it up ! 
the strap looks great . 
very cool design and looks good on my tele . 
and all for 7 bucks w / prime shipping . 
so why only 3-stars ? 
this is my fourth strap purchase from planet waves . 
i have grown to love planet waves ' straps for their comfort and durability , and obviously the designs . 
i thought that this strap was the same as my others only with a different design . 
mainly because at my local music shops , i have never seen/felt a planet waves strap that was not made out of their usual thick , soft , and durable material -lrb- whatever that might be -rrb- that i have grown to love . 
this strap is very thin and brittle feeling , which makes it very uncomfortable to use . 
this strap does slide easily on your shirt -lrb- which is what i prefer -rrb- but once it makes contact with your neck it is sharp and it makes your neck sore and itchy . 
needless to say this strap is definitely not suited for playing without a shirt on , ouch ! 
i have tried running it through the washing machine a few times with fabric softener along with using it constantly to try to get it broken in . 
but it is still as sharp as it was out of the package . 
maybe with years and years of use it will finally soften up . 
that is if it lasts that long.overall what you need to know is that this strap is not the same as the other planet waves straps . 
the material is very thin and brittle feeling ; unlike the many other straps from planet waves . 
if comfort is not important to you then get this strap . 
the price ca n't be beat and will give your guitar that 70 's look . 
if i would have paid $ 20 + on this strap i would be furious . 
but at only $ 7 this strap is still a steal . 
when i first felt this strap , i smiled ... this is so supple to the touch , making playing with it a great experience . 
yet it 's durable enough even for the roughest of players . 
it is fully adjustable , allowing for all body types . 
this is the first strap that i 've bought in a long time . 
i have a planet waves strap with studs and i like it very much . 
i ` ts the only strap i 've ever used . 
untill now . 
now i have it put away and i 'm using this one . 
if yore looking for a new strap , i highly recommend this one . 
trust me ... you will not be disapointed by it . 
yeah it looks a little plain , but it does n't slide around while playing and i love it !! 
buy it already !! 
xd i got this strap just to try something different than a nylon . 
at first it was kind of weird since the strap grips your shirt a little bit and wrinkles it up if you try to move it around . 
but after a while i found it a quite useful feature of this strap because your guitar wont slide around when you 're playing and will stay nice and steady while playing . 
those with neck heavy guitars might also want to give this a shot since it grips so well . 
it is also very long , longer than i thought . 
i have it slung a little low , and there 's plenty of slack left on the strap . 
so it 's probably long enough for shaq to use it and still sling it as low as james hetfield . 
the only complaint i have about this guitar is the fact that it was a little tough to get on my epiphone les paul . 
but again it adds another feature to the strap , since the thing is n't falling off anytime soon ! 
i almost feel like i wont even need strap locks it 's so good . 
also the holes are very strong and have not torn open at all , which usually happens on a heavy guitar like the one i have . 
all in all a perfect buy for the money . 
this strap is nice and comfortable but your guitar will fall off of it easily . 
i plan on using strap locks so it wo n't matter to me but if you do n't use strap locks , your guitar may hit the floor and ruin your whole day.my advise . 
install strap locks on all of your guitars and protect your investment . 
then choose comfortable straps that wo n't scratch your guitar -lrb- like this one -rrb- . 
this is a nice leather strap , not thick , but very functional and nice looking . 
i found it a bit uncomfortable with a heavyweight electric guitar , but should work just fine with an acoustic . 
nice strap , i meant its just a basic strap , so its not gon na blow your mind or anything but its of very good quality from what i can tell so far . 
should last a while with good care . 
good leather good build , made to last and age nicely . 
i like leather best of all things it feels proper , and i like simple let the guitar stand out , keep the strap simple but elegant . 
this is a very good general purpose strap ! 
a little stiff , but i 'm hoping it will loosen up with use . 
would not say it is the best feeling strap but does look very nice . . 
it is a little stiff feeling compared to the others i have purchased but overall it is very nice . 
yes , a iittle white flaking but no biggie unless you have a black case interior ... easy to install strap locks ... use on blue strat and looks great . . 
enjoy i felt i needed a white strap for an extra one to have around . 
this makes a good spare , but i would not use it and trust it on stage . 
it is thin leather and does n't seem like it will hold up under any abusive situation . 
that 's just my opinion of it , you may not see it like that and have no fear of it . 
i would fear it . 
i do question the leather part but since it does n't say what kind of leather i suppose thats fine , its still a good strap either way . 
it 's well made . 
not much else you can say about it . 
buy it . 
it is worth it . 
packaged very well . 
i have had really good luck with the planet wave patch cables . 
they have n't had a huge amount of use , but none of them have went bad or caused any excess noise , and i 've bought over 10 of them . 
it comes with a lifetime guarantee and feels really sturdy . 
they come in many lengths and it is sleek and effective . 
great price as well . 
i purchased a bunch of planet waves classic cables for my new pedal board . 
the cable is a little fat at the connector for pedal board use so if you have a tight fit this is not the cable for you . 
however , i am very pleased to find the cable itself is quite flexible . 
my complaint , like other reviews i read , is that the end does n't seem to fit snug on some connections . 
for me these cables fit very well with the mxr pedals , dunlop wah and the ibanez pedal . 
the boss pedals however , were hit or miss . 
ca n't say for sure if this is plant waves design problem or boss , but it does seem odd it seems to be mostly the boss pedals . 
i have a couple ehx pedals also , one side is snug the other loose . 
anyway , for the money , i think you will be happy with the planet waves cable , nice moulded ends with a good flexible cable . 
planet waves knows hot to make great quality and economic stuff . 
all of the cables in my pedalboard are planet waves this is just another cable out there - there is nothing special in particular about it . 
it does what it should . 
cheers ! 
exactly what i needed to set up my pedal board . 
the flexibility is awesome , you can wind it underneath and around the pedal board and still plug it in to the pedals with out straining . 
great flatwound strings . 
i put these on my j-bass over a year ago and they still sound and feel awesome . 
they are stainless steel and very smooth . 
i have never tried other flats accept for chromes on my tele and fender tapewounds on my fretless , so my view may be biased . 
for what i paid and how they sound , feel , and have lasted , i am very pleased . 
this is my first tube amp and after doing a ton of research , i found that the vox ac15c1 was just about perfect for me.it came down to the ac15 , fender blues jr. and the ibanez ts15 . 
the blues jr. has a somewhat small enclosure for a 1x12 and i felt it had a bit of a `` boxy '' tone , otherwise , it 's a great amp . 
the ibanez has a classic tube screamer circuit built in and a switch which cuts the wattage in half for playing at lower volumes , but it lacked a reverb circuit , which was a deal breaker -lrb- silly reasoning , i know -rrb- . 
the ac15 has a larger enclosure than the blues jr. , and it has a reverb and tremolo circuit , so it had the features i was looking for and most importantly , it produces some killer tone.if you 've ever seen or read a review of this amp , chances are , you 've heard about the classic vox `` chime '' , which this amp has , but i fell in love with the natural tube saturation on the top boost channel right away . 
the normal channel will break up nicely too , but i would suggest an a/b switch and run the normal channel fairly clean and the top boost pretty dirty.i was worried at first that 15 watts would n't be enough , but fear not , this amp is loud ... maybe too loud as i 'm just a hobbyist that plays in the bedroom , but that 's not a bad thing . 
it totally blows away my 100 watt marshall solid state and i have n't put the volume much past 8 o'clock for fear that my wife may beat me to death if i do.while there is no effects loop , it takes pedals well , but for distorted tones , i 've found myself just plugging straight in just to get the unadulterated tube crunch , which i 've come to love so much . 
as stated above , the lack of a foot switch to change between clean and dirty tones will have to be solved by either running a dirt box in front of the amp , or as previously stated , running one channel clean and one channel dirty and us an a/b switch to go between them . 
as far as other effects , i really like what it does to my tc electronic flashback delay and corona chorus . 
note that there is a foot switch jack in the back panel , but it controls the on/off for the built in tremolo and reverb , but it 's sadly not included with the amp.for my first tube amp , i do n't think i could have done much better ; i love the tone that i can get , the tube warmth is just sooo much more soulful than the sterile sound from a solid state amp , it 's feature rich , and takes pedals well . 
the other two amps that i was considering were a little less expensive , and while i really feel that the vox is just a better all around amp , i do n't think you can go wrong with any one of the three.the weight -lrb- about 50 lbs -rrb- , and the lack of an included foot switch are really the only two cons that i can think of . 
while i would have picked up all three of the amps that i was looking at if i had the means , i would not hesitate to recommend this amp to anyone looking for their first or next tube amp . 
i 've had this for about 3 years and i agree with every one here that this is a fantastic amp at a good price point . 
it 's a wonderful sounding amp and gives you good chimey cleans and lush distorted breakup . 
it only gets better as the speaker breaks in so make sure you put lots of hours on it initially and you will be rewarded . 
if it was between this an a blues jr. which are similarly powered and priced i 'd opt for this in a second . 
i think the ac15c1 is actually a better blues amp . 
-lrb- opinions vary of course -rrb- i only have a couple is `` wishes '' as they 're not really gripes . 
one is the stock reverb . 
it 's really overboard in a way that i did n't find musical . 
i ordered a new tank and now it 's great . 
i hope vox changed this out because i found anything over 2 on the stock tank way too much . 
second would be an fx loop . 
not a deal breaker as the amp takes pedals well but it would a good feature as wold be channel switching built in . 
third and last i wish it came with a footswitch to turn the trem and verb on/off and switch between the top boost and normal channels . 
i know you can get it aftermarket but it would have been nice . 
probably one of the reasons it 's so affordable.and speaking of foot switches do yourself a favor and get an a/b/y switch for this . 
it allows you to switch between the top boost/normal channels and also allows you to run through both channels at the same time and let me tell you there are some really sweet tones when you run both channels at once . 
i 've gone through a fair amount of gear in my time but do n't see getting rid of this . 
it 's such a fun little amp that it 's nice to have around even if it were not my main go-to amp . 
it 's certainly loud enough for small venues and jamming with a controlled drummer but it 's not going to shake the paint off the walls like an ac30 . 
highly recommended . 
at the $ 600 price point for an all tube amp plus reverb and tremelo -lrb- well , there are two pedals i wo n't have to buy -rrb- this is insane . 
it is not only really loud , but you can do anything from jangly pop to pink floyd to hard rock -lrb- high gain modern metal heads , though , might want to look at engl -rrb- . 
i dialed in a richie blackmore tone the other day and just started blasting away.it 's also a hefty beast and should stand up to sustained use.the only thing that was a drag about it was that the footswitch , which controls the reverb and tremolo , is sold separately -lrb- at about $ 40 street -rrb- and everybody was out . 
i managed to snag one , but it involved a bit of luck . 
they should be restocking stores in a couple of weeks . 
i can see this strap lasting a long time . 
i love how i do n't need new strap buttons , considering that the screws may be smaller than the original strap button screws -lrb- which facilitates the strap button falling out and your guitar smacks the limestone floor ! -rrb- . 
you can lock each strap button with one hand - great product ! 
for a fender guitar bullets are the best choice for tone and longevity of strings . 
they seat snug and enhances sustain . 
quality can be found behind the fender name . 
these original bullets are great for my strat . 
they are made specifically for the fender tremolo bridge and fit perfect . 
the strings sound great and hold up to the &#34; whammy &#34; just fine . 
sound great and look great . 
fender accessories 073-3150-406 pure nickel electric guitar strings , custom are very good!i got it for my strat guitar and they sound much better then ernie ball or d'addario -lrb- at least on my taste -rrb- . 
recommend it . 
the product is great . 
a lot of nice features . 
i am running it through a little cube amp to practice withand it is not the kind of amp you want to use . 
best results are going to be with an amp that allows you toloop through another available channel and bypass any effects you have on the amp like distortion . 
if you havethe amp overdriven , then the loop comes out that way too , and the byproduct of that as well on a smaller less capableamp is noise cancellation.trying to solo over a rhythm part for instance cancels out the signal being sent from the pedal through the speakerand clobbers what you 're trying to play over.great pedal , but have a good amp with multiple inputs to put it through . 
i got these for my dad for christmas . 
he loved them all and wo n't quit playing with them . 
i figured he would put them into his collection of cool things he 's amassed , but he uses them daily to play the ibanez acoustic/electric i got him . 
the mxr csp202 or dunlop custom comp is exactly what i 'd been searching for ... for years i played with only a crybaby and a phase 45 on the floor and everything else in a rack system . 
the rack systems had amazing studio quality compression and big complex delay boards , blah blah blah ... but these days everything i have sits on a furman spb-8c pedal board -lrb- highly recommended -rrb- and so i 've been quietly searching for a serviceable foot pedal compressor , and that is harder to find than i had previously imagined ... apparently they are n't easy to make . . ? 
i 've been through 4 -lrb- cou n't 'em four -rrb- foot pedal compressors and was n't at all happy ... an engineer mixer buddy said go try this pedal mxr csp202 - so i did - and it 's perfect ... benefits :1 -rrb- it 's easy to match your output gain on the pedal - so when you step on it - the pedal activates quality compression and not output volume suppression2 -rrb- it 's easy to understand right away - 3 seconds of looking at the pedal and you 're done - 3 minutes of fooling around with it and you get it3 -rrb- it 's quiet but very effective and professional sounding4 -rrb- it 's solid and works exactly like very expensive rack compressionnegatives :1 -rrb- it 's expensive considering there are compression pedals for 1/2 this price2 -rrb- it 's got the 9 volt power supply connector on the wrong side of the input quarter inch jackover all the thing is a home run - you can work around he poorly located 9 volt connection - you can wait a few weeks and save a few more dollars if you need to , but you ca n't fix a bad compression pedal if you buy the wrong one ... i highly recommend this pedal , after a long process of searching and being disappointed i 'm glad i found this pedal this is the godzilla of volume pedals . 
it is a beautiful , massive , piece of metallic magic that appears to have no loss of tone as i run signal through it . 
it appears to be indestructible . 
i like that it has a &#34; tuner output &#34; and that the stiffness of the pedal action can be adjusted with a large slotted screwdriver . 
when a friend offered to sell his for $ 30 bucks i bought it without hesitation . 
i now have one in the front of my system and the second is placed farther down right after my ditto looper so i can fade it out . 
volume swells can be done from either pedal with slightly different results . 
if you need &#34; light &#34; , maybe keep looking . 
if you do n't mind the heft , you will be pleased . 
i like this volume pedal because you can beat on it and drop it and kick it and misuse the hell out of it and it still works . 
why that 's overly important in a volume pedal i 'm not sure but this one is built like a tank and can stand the beating of regular gigging . 
it takes up a huge footprint on a board so i generally run it at the end of the chain and to the side but the large footprint allows for getting your whole shoe/boot on the thing and that is comforting while playing . 
overall the pedal has a good throw or travel to it and does n't suck the tone like other volume pedals . 
good buy - i bought this usa fender product to replace an imported piece of junk . 
imports often have threads other than 1/4 inch sae . 
it fit perfectly on the jack socket threads . 
quick install , works like a dream . 
i purchase this because my older springs wont return to it original place leaving my guitar tuning a half step up or down when using the whammy bar , this fender springs work excellent and fit perfectly on my jackson dk2 , i 'm using 3 springs right know and stay 's in tune no matter the abuse.the only con on this product is that they are noisy , is not that you will hear it in a rehearsal with a band or a concert but you definitely will hear them when you are alone practicing . 
i ordered these because i wanted to deck the tremolo on my strats because i do n't really use the trem . 
i have a modern american standard and an american vintage reissue hot rod 62 strat . 
there are differences in the bridge and tremolo block but as far as i can tell the springs are the same other than the modern ones are black . 
my standard now has 3 black and 2 silver springs but the 62 hot rod has 5 of the silver which are a perfect match for the ones that it came with . 
easy to install and works like a charm . 
i purchased a set of fender vintage tremelo tension springs in order to `` beef up '' the tremelo tension on an inexpensive squier jagmaster guitar that i recently purchased . 
these springs clearly are better and more consistently made than the springs that came on the jagmaster -lrb- the loop actually goes all the way around , which is not the case with the springs that came on the guitar -rrb- and it seems that they are of a higher tension . 
highly recommended as replacement springs , or to supplement the three springs that come on less expensive guitars . 
at first i wanted to get these to replace the 3 cheap springs to came in my mim stratocaster for it was the last thing i needed to change to have a functional reliable floating tremolo . 
after installing these tremolo springs -lrb- which by the way have a nice flexible tension -rrb- i notice that my tone and sustain greatly improved . 
i did some research and found out there are other websites out there that sell vintage specs tremolo tension springs for like $ 20 - $ 30 to enhance tone and sustain on stratocasters ! 
so at $ 8 this is definitely a win !!! 
fender springs . 
you 'll need a pliers or needle nose to grab and stretch them to reach the hole . 
there 's too much tension to do it with your fingers . 
my american special strat came with 3 springs and now has the five . 
i find it stays in tune like a &#34; instrument &#34; should now . 
got this to put into my pseudo-caster project guitar . 
love it ! 
be warned , it does not come with springs , claw or trem bar . 
if you order this , get the tremolo bar for the mexican model . 
the threads are smaller on these.if you like to do &#34; dive bombs &#34; , you will need to grind a bevel on a small portion this massive sustain block . 
it will hit the back of the cavity before getting anywhere near absolute floppiness.last important note ... make sure you measure your outer pivot screw distance . 
if it matches spec on this trem , all the screw holes will match up . 
very nice bridge . 
this was an oem part so did n't come with screws , springs , claw , or tremolo bar , just the bridge itself . 
not the best but for the price was a killer deal . 
the block is full size , probably zinc or some mystery metal , vintage bent saddles . 
would be a good replacement for an older mim strat with the smaller block , or other asian import , or just to replace one that 's wore out . 
like i stated it was dirt cheap and decent quality . 
this is a cheap and easy upgrade !!! 
at about 20 years old , my mim standard strats ' hardware was starting to show her age . 
most of the screws and the bridge had some surface rust . 
for about $ 40 bucks , i was able to replace all the screws , springs , bridge , neck plate . 
this is stage one of my rebuild . 
the tone block on the replacement bridge has about twice the mass as the original which increases the tonal quality 10 fold . 
do n't forget the bridge screws as this bridge replacement does not come with them . 
i use these strings for my telecasters and i have to say the tone is wonderful , beside they last for weeks without turning a different color because of the use . 
very bright and really convenient for the looks of the guitar . 
these are great strings and were my favorite until i found fender pure nickel strings . 
some may like the sound of these some may like the pure nickel having trouble with my usual d'adderio strings i decided to go back to the a well known brand . 
these are solid strings that never let me down . 
they go in tune and stay in tune . 
i just wish they had a little bit slinkier feel to them . 
theses strings really have a good tone and tremolo stability greatly improves !!! 
the heavy bottons 32 , 42 and 52 adds a boom in the tone . 
the others , 10 , 13 and 17 are nicely and decent tone also . 
i do n't rate it 5 stars for the lack of vci . 
when i opened the pack there were no plastic anti corrosion protection . 
the high strings were plenty of flakes . 
if fender solved that it would be perfect . 
i had an issue with my new squire guitar , and fender hooked me up with a set of these . 
the string ends have a cylindrical or bullet shaped end , rather then the typical small loop . 
the theory is that the larger bullet end makes better contact in the tremolo cavity . 
i say they sound great and are worth trying . 
i just order 3-packs so i can have some on hand . 
picks are picks right ? 
select your material , select your weight , and you 're done , right?no ! 
these picks have this difficult to describe pattern molded into them ... they &#34; grip &#34; your fingers ... it 's uncanny ... they do not slip.i would n't touch anything but fender mediums for years and years ... tried these on a whim ... not i have piles and piles of picks going unused ... these are that good ! 
i have been playing music for years and often i lose my picks during a performance . 
i took a chance on these picks a few years ago and since then not one have slipped through my fingers ! 
best pick ever !!! 
not too hard , not too soft . 
my friend gave me this pick and i missed it after using .36 mm . 
everyone has their own preference and i just did n't like the feel of those . 
i bought this 12 pack and they ... are ... awesome !! 
i lost like 3 already but hey , there 's more . 
i use them for my electric and acoustic guitar . 
i normally use dunlop &#8217; s 0.60 mm nylon picks , but decided to give the 0.60 mm max-grips a try , when the price dropped to $ 3.00 for a dozen.the top half of the max-grips have a special surface with tiny ridges , that gently bite into the skin to provide a nice secure grip . 
the feeling is a little strange at first , but you should get used to it quickly.i like the feel and playability of the 0.60 mm max grip &#8217; s , but they are little more flexible than i prefer , so if i were to get another set , i would get a thicker type , either0 .73 mmor0 .88 mm . 
i have used the manhasset orchestra light , and this is definitely an improvement , it distributes a nice soft light evenly through the whole page , unlike the manhasset light which tends to be rather uneven . 
it illuminates my entire largemanhasset m54 regal conductor 's music standquite well by itself.having said that , for a 40 bucks light , it feels rather flimsy to me . 
in both construction and light brightness , it does not compare well with traditional clamp or desk lights , all of which are usually much cheaper -lrb- the issue being mainly the light switch , the jury is out about the clamp , though it seems strong -rrb- . 
of course , as an orchestra light , it could n't be much brighter without defeating its intended purpose , i am just pointing out that i feel it is n't worth 40 dollars , when you consider the whole field of similar lights -lrb- those not intended for orchestra -rrb- . 
i bought this because of reputation and reviews , but it should probably cost the same as its closest competitor , therechargeable music stand led light clip-on 9 leds with adapter . 
that one has the same negative issues as this light , but at a much more acceptable $ 18.99 plus free shipping.one more thing , you should ignore the `` frequently bought together '' suggestion to get themighty bright 80910 bright light cradlefor this light . 
i bought it , and can confirm they are totally incompatible , and anyways , this light has a huge clamp which can be used to carefully balance the light on a desk without clamping , if desired . 
i bought this because i had a gig in a dark bar . 
i used this on my music stand on the lowest setting and it worked perfectly . 
for some songs i have three sheet of paper -lrb- which overlapped about an inch -rrb- and the light covered all three pages easily with no dark spots . 
i ca n't imagine in what situation i would ever need to use the brighter setting . 
i was thinking of getting the cheaper/smaller version , but did n't want to risk it not covering three pages . 
the gig bag is a square and softly padded . 
there is a lot of dead space in the bag and no support in those empty areas or the corners so i do n't expect much protection for the light or adapter . 
treat the light like it has no bag and you 'll be fine . 
they include 3 batteries -lrb- i did n't see them until i pulled out the adapter for this review -rrb- to get you started using the light , but the adapter works well and has a very long cord so if you are using the adapter at a gig you should n't have to worry about it making it to your power supply . 
a terribly easy install and good quality straplock . 
i am pleased that they match my telecaster . 
straplocks are a must for any electric guitar and these exceed that need . 
this is one beefy string winder . 
there is really no comparison between this professional tool and those cheesy $ 2 toy string winders you find 100 to a bin at the accessories counter of your nameless local guitar superstore.pros : - very sturdy - rotates extremely smoothly - well balanced - fits every guitar tuning key i 've tried - high-impact plastic body should withstand years -lrb- decades ? -rrb- 
of abuse - clandestine compartment in handle was a nice bonus -- for earplugs , extra end pins , whatevercons : - none whatsoever.buy this immediately and save your wrists for more lucrative pursuits . 
this product does what it is designed to do , very very well . 
it is not used very often but when it is , it works beautifully . 
i use it to wind my strings ! 
i recommend for the use of stringing up your guitar easily and fast . 
very easy to use ! 
i have been using a zt lunchbox amp for about a year . 
blindfolded you wo n't confuse it with a marshall stack or a blackface deluxe but for a small , portable , solid state amp it works as advertised . 
people that say it is loud are n't kidding but there are limits . 
the sound from the 6.5 '' speaker requires some space to develop . 
up close it can be painfully loud but the sound is rather directional and it lacks bass . 
i use mine for practice at home and for low-volume band rehearsals . 
i played it once on stage , mic 'd through a pa , but was n't happy with the sound and switched to a tube amp with a 12 '' speaker.to me it sounds best with humbuckers but i 've played single coil guitars -lrb- fender and gibson -rrb- through it with usable results . 
if you are after clean volume you might be disappointed . 
it only gets so loud before distortion -lrb- and noise -rrb- becomes annoying . 
players that use a lot of distortion -lrb- e.g. , metal -rrb- will get a lot more out of this amp than players that need cleaner sounds at volume . 
while the zt lunchbox is n't as versatile as some other small amps , it is great for a `` one trip '' load in at rehearsals.one thing to consider is adding the matching zt extension cabinet . 
it makes a big difference in two ways : two 6.5 '' speakers move more air and the doubled speaker cone area helps thicken the sound . 
also , because the speakers can be angled and separated the area covered by the sound is increased . 
this is a big help at rehearsals . 
i point one cabinet towards myself and the other into the room . 
i 've tried using a guitar speaker cab , a pa speaker , and a pa floor monitor as an extension speaker but the zt extension cabinet sounds best to me . 
it 's the same size as the zt lunchbox and they thoughtfully put the handle on the back so you can stack them.for an ultra-portable guitar -lrb- or harmonica -rrb- amplifier that can get decently loud the zt lunchbox is hard to beat . 
but if you are particular about tone you might find that a lower wattage practice amp with a 12 '' speaker works better . 
i started with the flimsy grays . 
a couple years ago i switched to yellows . 
recently i 've been learning the art of arpeggio sweeps and this pick is the -lrb- -rrb- ! 
for all that are having tone probs with this pick , consider this . 
your used to using big picks , which strum hard easily . 
with these i noticed i have to strum in a tighter , stronger pattern than before to get the same tones . 
anyway , the attack on this pick is so just . . 
yes ! 
it flows in sweeps like ... . 
yes ! 
i will never switch from the pick . 
oh ya , the grip is perfect . 
have n't popped one outa my fingers yet . 
just my two cents . 
i have some neurological problems with my picking hand , and ca n't seem to hold onto picks . 
i really like these max grips a lot , and have found that they are excellent for soloing . 
great tone as well . 
for my tastes , they are are a bit stiff for strumming , but perfect for everything else . 
i love the size and would n't want anything larger . 
the advantage of these over the dava jazz picks is that if they do move about in your grip , you can still pick with them . 
the davas have a rubber coating over the grip part and can only be used on the sharp side . 
i would say the davas are slightly more flexible -lrb- literally , not figuratively -rrb- . 
i use the dava jazz for more rhythm oriented playing . 
can not recall how these picks are with my acoustic , as i 've been on an electric fixation lately.also a fan of the regular jazz iiis and find they do n't slip as much as my dunlop tortex picks . 
i think this is due to both the materials of the pick and the raised lettering . 
still , in terms of grip , they do n't hold a candle to the max grips . 
both picks have their own unique tonal character.i 've tried a variety of picks and i think that once you get used to smaller picks , you will find the larger styles feel clumsy and awkward . 
these jazz picks are also great for pinch harmonics . 
they are just a bit difficult to adjust in my hand on the fly because they are so grippy.overall , these are my picks of choice , for my style , which is blues-oriented . 
surprised there are so few reviews.edit : the strumming issue can be overcome with playing around with pick angle . 
it 's getting easier with these . 
i have also since found that while these are fantastic picks , i actually prefer thedunlop jazz iii pick pack , red nylon ,1.38 mmdespite lack of the max-grip raised lettering . 
they are just the most wonderful picks i 've used . 
i do plan to try out some 2mm picks , however , as i suspect i 'm going to prefer a thicker pick ; the iii nylons feels slightly thicker than the max-grips , which i believe is why i prefer them . 
with the grips these are comfortable and not as prone to falling out of your and when your hand gets moist from sweat these will not wear down which is amazing and they have all the same great qualities as all the other jazz iii 's . 
the only problem i have with them is dirt can get between the grip pretty easily which makes them slip but if you clean them well then its not a problem . 
i buy these for my son . 
he loves the grip on them as they help stop them from slipping out of his hands . 
he also likes the small size . 
they last forever and do n't break . 
these have the correct thickness and texture that i want , but they are smaller than a typical pick . 
so be sure to try them out first before buying . 
one just can not tell the size from the picture amazon has . 
i wish they put a reference picture by the side of this pick -lrb- may be dim the ref image a little so people wo n't get confused -rrb- . 
some people swear by these , but i that find my fingers get a little numb after playing these for an hour or two . 
may be you need to get acclimated to this pick before you can fully use it effectively and for long duration . 
i wo n't be buying these again . 
i 've always used jazz picks for my electric guitar work . 
danny gatton did so , and i would n't have it any other way . 
these are the absolute best picks i 've ever used . 
they do n't wear down as easily as delrin , tortex , or some other materials . 
and , these have a really , really nice textured surface that keeps them from slipping out of your fingers . 
i think i 'm going to order these in massive bulk quantities and stash them away in case they ever decide to stop manufacturing these ... the dunlop max grip jazz iii carbon fiber picks really helped improve my accuracy , no doubt in large part due to their relative stiffness and profile . 
i tend to drop picks and have tried numerous brands and types of picks , but for ease of grip these are hard to beat . 
i am a relatively inexperienced player , and while more experienced players can address technical subtleties better than i can , i have come to depend on these as they have helped me to hugely improve my picking accuracy in a relatively short time . 
as far as durability goes , they are the reigning champs . 
i bought a pack of six , and i 've been using them for a while now and ca n't tell them apart : the three i 've used look like the three that are still in the bag to my eye . 
i doubt seriously i will need to buy more for months -lrb- who knows , maybe years -rrb- as they just do n't seem to wear even after hours and hours of use . 
i recommend these picks without reservation . 
a very nice pick , both in feel and texture . 
only complaint is that it 's fairly small - about the size of a canadian or us five cent piece , where most of your typical guitar pick are bigger - about the size of a 25 cent piece . 
but that 's okay . 
i got this the same time as i got a set of jim dunlop 427p3 dun ultex jazz iii , the yellowish ones , and dava jazz grip 9024 red picks , and i think i like the dava picks the best . 
all three are &#34; tight grip &#34; picks , and all the same size , but they 're all good . 
these picks have a great grip , though , and feel dry and gritty even when they 're clean as a bone . 
nice ! 
sounded good . 
warmer sounding than stock tubes in my ac15 . 
i rocked all night and loved the sound . 
next day i turned it on , my amp was crackling out and wiping out the signal i checked the tubes and one of them was making violent purple flashes before the signal burnt out . 
i then noticed that one of my fuses blew out as well . 
i changed out the fuse and checked again and the tube was still doing the same thing so i just swapped the tubes back for atock . 
id like to see a real set of jjs , im sure one of them was a dud . 
my first amp with el84 's is a totally scratch built older single channel trinity ac15 , which is based on a lightning . 
initially installed jj el84 's after reading so many good reviews about them . 
they sound great to me -lrb- personal opinion of course -rrb- , and are priced right . 
thought about new sensor mullard ri 's or sovtek el84m/7189 's . 
glad i went with the jj 's , and not looking back . 
i 'm running 365vdc on the plates and 340vdc on the screens . 
first set , one red plated slightly . 
bought a second set from doug 's tubes , ruby el84cz 's -lrb- select matched jj 's -rrb- . 
performing nicely with a stock mim strat . 
also using a sovtek 12ax7lps in the pi spot and a post-pi master volume , just like matchless . 
tubes come out of the same two or three places anymore ... there is a definate consistancey issue and a few places where the seller -lrb- jj tubes -rrb- can specify specs to make their particular tube stand out . 
jj seems to have a smoother sound than most . 
i 've recently replaced the tubes in a little voxac4 mini and two epiphone valve jr 's that came with sovtek el84 's and 12ax7 's and am really impressed with the discernable difference in tone . 
there was a real payoff in this small change , the pre-amp tubes made the rest of the difference . 
you do n't need to spend big money for tubes ... these jj 's work really great . 
bought a couple of these as replacement tubes for my bass amp , and i think they improved the sound over the original eh ones . 
these are considered `` boutique tubes '' , but i think they 're popular for a reason . 
after having played the yamaha ypg-535 88-key portable grand piano keyboard in a showroom and loving it , i was torn , wondering what all i would be missing out on if i went with the more economically priced ypg-235 . 
i now own the 235 and it appears as if i am missing out on twelve keys . 
that is , i am not experiencing even an ounce of buyer 's remorse after opting for the cheaper 235 . 
this is a lovely keyboard with more beautiful voices than i will ever know what to do with and extremely user friendly functionality . 
of course , my opinion should be taken with a grain of salt as i will be the first to admit that my experience with other products of this variety is extremely limited . 
as such , it might be best to say that , for a novice , one could not ask for a better instrument for the price.so what is the difference between the 235 and the 535 ? 
based on my previous comparative shopping , i have come up with a few differences . 
first is the obvious fact that the 535 possesses 88 keys , while the 235 has 76 . 
the 535 also includes a stand , sustain pedal , and power adapter , which must be purchased separately for the 235 . 
while i am unaware of the specifics , the 535 also has greater storage capacity and capability as well as a few more voices . 
beyond these definitive differences , having now played both models , the 535 also wins out with regard to aesthetics in that it looks and feels to be of a slightly higher quality , from its display to the apparent craftsmanship in assembly.why buy the ypg-235 ? 
if price is not an issue , go ahead and get he 535 , it is a beautiful instrument . 
however , for those on a budget or for those who simply do not need 88 keys , purchase the 235 . 
like the 535 , the 235 possesses piano style graded soft touch -lrb- gst -rrb- keys , which are not exactly weighted but occupy that perfect gap between pure synth keys and weighted . 
the feel is perfect for one who is used to standard synth-style keyboard keys yet longs for a little more control without sacrificing playability . 
the 235 , like the 535 , also features usb connectivity and general midi compatibility , as well as almost all of the same high quality voices , which separate both the 535 and the 235 from many other models in their price brackets -lrb- besides the pianos , the multitude of stringed instrument voices are amazingly realistic -rrb- . 
while it is unfortunate that yamaha decided to not include a power adapter with the 235 , theyamaha survival kit d - accessory kit for yamaha ypg-235 & ypg-235 keyboardswhich includes a power adaptor , extended warranty , and a couple of other low quality extras can be purchased relatively cheaply . 
in my opinion , the ypg-235 offers the buyer more bang for their comparative buck . 
again , the 235 sounds great , feels great and is hard to beat for the price ! 
this is a great microphone . 
it 's light , sensitive , and looks professional . 
i used this alongside my xonar dg sound card and my recordings sounded clear even when boosted +22 db . 
i would recommend this for anyone looking to do amateur voice recording . 
this could be a great mic and is similar to the shure sm58 . 
but i 've found that most of these pyle pro audio products tend to have a much higher signal to noise ratio . . 
even plugged into my best preamps in studio . 
spend more money , get some quality mics . 
these are only good for garage practice on a budget . 
have n't used it with the singer in my band but hooked it up to my amp for a short test . 
it doesnt appear to be doa and as some of the other reviewers say , it does n't appear that i have to be within centimeters for it to pick up . 
i looked at all the wires inside and they look ok . 
nothing out of the ordinary.i 'd say if you were carlos santana , you might want a better mic , but for those of us in garage bands and local bars , for the price ? 
come on . 
how do you beat it ? 
good , but it not fit properly , defenley better then bone thogh i did have to sand it to try to make it fit good , and i did put it on my epiphone lp , it does give a nice blues tone , beause it 's not bone . 
but i had to take it off case it just did not fit right for the money you cant beat this cable . 
works with the new mic my daughter got for christmas and nice quality cord . 
will buy more in the future cords are cords but these are very nice , packaged great , good deal instant turnaround ... easy , affordable , fast , why go out ? 
just go to amazon . 
these guys did a super job getting them here fast ... . 
they care about musicians ... . 
we are a tough act to follow ... right so look for accesories and cables/cords . . 
etc. . . 
at orange county and amazon ... thanks for caring guys ... i just did a quick mic test with this cable and everything sounded good . 
it coils nicely and has good connectors . 
work perfectly with my guitar , good price . 
no problems with static , crackling , hum or other sound artifacts . 
great for amateur vocal recording like me . 
i bought this audio cable and all i got ta say is that this thing can last and it will not give you any trouble . 
good stuff ! 
needed an xlr cable for a gig and ordered one of these the week before ... it got the job done , my bass sounded great through the pa , and the crowd loved the band . 
home run ! 
works great , appears to be well made , good connectors , twenty five foot allows a great deal of movement , good value this is actually quite good , no problems after 2 seasons of work , and the neutrik knock-off connectors plug into devices well . 
the funny thing is they do n't connect that easily to each other , like you might do for storage or to extend a cable run , but a little finagling will get them to mate . 
i 'm not one to cheap out on a lot of things , but some cable prices are kinda ridiculous nowadays . 
i 'm not saying there is n't a place for high quality cables , but if you have jobs were you do n't need cables made of pure spun 100 % angel 's pubic hair , these will get the job done . 
i read many negative reviews on several sites . 
i can understand how the quality may not be consistent , but as a seasoned folk and ethnic musician , i must say that the set i just purchased is quite good , especially the lower pitched harps in g , a and bb . 
there are minor tuning issues with all instruments , especially folk instruments . 
this is what gives them their charm and voice . 
i find my whole set to be of very adequate quality and i will not need replacement harps right away , as many have stated they had to do . 
the set is quite nice , for the price ! 
great for the beginner ! 
great product ! 
easy to use and i was able to shield my entire jazz bass . 
it would have been nice to get a little more of it though , since this was just enough . 
the picks work well with bass , but they are just too thick to use with ukulele . 
the pics also shed easily , making your instrument dusty in no time . 
this does exactly what a music stand is supposed to do , this thing is awesome !!! 
i love it ... thanks forsuch a great affordable product yea how could a music stand be amazing ? 
well compared to those worthless folding portable pieces of junk - this is a godsent . 
it actually hold by 500 song fake book -lrb- you know the one - that weighs about 10 pounds ! -rrb- . 
it stays where you set it and works wonderfully . 
no complaints ! 
i have this pop filter clamped onto myon stage stands ms7701 tripod boom microphone standthe pop filter is double layered and spaced out fairly well . 
it provides at extra layer to reduce the p 's , f 's , t 's , etc. . 
it also is good for preventing moisture and spit from going into your precious microphone.surprisingly , the gooseneck really does not make any noise when you move it . 
the gooseneck is sturdy . 
it is flexible yet stationary.this product does exactly what it intends to do with a quality build.buy with confidence ! 
this is a pop filter . 
it does a fantastic job at that . 
the plastic rings feel a little cheap , but that is just because they need to be lightweight . 
ultimately , this is a great pop filter and the goose-neck is very strong but flexible . 
i would highly recommend this piece , as it also enforces a strong habit of stepping away from the microphone just a bit and not getting too close . 
the gooseneck holds its position well when adjusted into place in front of the microphone . 
also , the clamp works well . 
however , the gooseneck initially made some snapping sounds when flexing it - that now seems to be in the past , generally ; perhaps , it 's a tubing issue.i have yet to try the pop filter with my microphone . 
i only have a low-cost mahala ukulele so i was n't expecting much of an improvement when i replaced the stock nylon strings , -lrb- after watching several youtube videos showing me how to do it -rrb- . 
i was wrong . 
these strings sound much better - the sound is much brighter and &#34; cleaner &#34; than the nylon strings my ukulele was supplied with when new . 
the aquila strings took about 30 minutes of continuous playing and stretching until they settled and now they stay tuned for long periods . 
my ukulele now sounds wonderful for such a cheap instrument and is limited only by my clumsy fingers . 
i would definitely recommend these strings to any uke player looking to replace their stock nylon strings with something better . 
my first kala ukulele had these strings on it from the factory and i 've never switched brands . 
everywhere you read , these are the strings to have ! 
i bought these for the soprano ukulele i bought for my little great niece . 
i do n't need to use them myself . 
i also have the same quality strings on my baritone ukulele . 
the strings are very good . 
if you have a inexpensive ukulele , the use of these string should improve the quality of the tone of your instrument . 
if you attach the new strings carefully , the time for them to settle down and stay in tune should not take very long . . 
theres a reason why so many uke manufacturers supply these strings as standard on their best ukes ... they are simply the best there is for a fair price . 
the sound brightens up and amplifies even the most dull sounding uke , and allows for a smooth experience once stretched properly . 
not much more can be said about these awesome strings ... stop reading this and order them ! 
:--rrb- i ordered one of these bad boys on a whim . 
it 's definitely the best verb it 's price range . 
you can dial in some pretty lush tones.it has a 3 way toggle , that changes it from hall , spring and room verbs.there 'd is also an a/b switch that is almost a tone mode . 
a is bright and in your face , and b is very lush and ambient.using these settings you can go from electro harmonix holy grail to fender spring reverb.also has a blend knob , which controls wet and dry signal mix , and time knob that controls , you guessed it reverb time and amount.very versatile.this pedal is built with great construction , though the first one i received was faulty . 
all sorts of popping and weird stuff going on.the 2nd one works flawlessly . 
seems very durable , switch and jacks are quality.i highly recommend getting a 1spot or 9v adapter b/c this thing drains batter power fast , though all modulation pedals do.this pedal does not suck tone , and is true bypass , though i wish this was n't , as i wish reverb trails were avail after the affect was turned off.for < $ 75 shipped i certainly ca n't complain.if you have any hesitations on the biyang stuff , i definitely recommend it . 
for any usable tones while playing live , the best bet is to plug it into a tube power amp . 
direct to mixer or running it through a solid state amp is very uninspiring.i did n't like the recorded tones either , much rather preferred amplitube 3 if micing a real tube amp was n't an option.that being said , it is good for practice and song writing . 
used this for more than a year and finally sold it ! 
that 's the other thing with items like this , they lose value real quick once the next version comes out . 
i needed a new microphone cable due to my son destroying the last one so this decided to invest more in a higher quality cable . 
this gls mic cable is working well . 
the build quality appears good and should be much harder for my son to break . 
i have only used it a couple of times but the cable works . 
it is what i expected it to be . 
this stand is useful for small instruments . . 
fits my tenor uke and violin just fine . 
any bigger than that , and the piece that holds the neck becomes too small -lrb- like a baby martin guitar -rrb- , etc. . 
hope this helps this is great but i needed an actual sound-hole cover . 
i bought this along with the planet waves screeching halt sound-hole cover . 
though only using it for a short time i did notice the bottom end seemed more focused . 
very pleased with this item . 
it really gives the guitar a richer mid sound and definitely picks up more of the bottom . 
definitely projects more of the sound from the sound hole . 
great work mat for electric and acoustic guitars as well as bass and stays at my workbench . 
however , i never leave it rolled out unless working on a guitar , to many other stray fragments of who knows what floating around in my workshop and i do n't want anything falling on mat that could potential scratch one of my babies ! 
i thought it would protect my desk but the pad is almost like that rubber they put under rugs so they wo n't slip around . 
maybe i should get that for cheaper.i accidently bought large , ooh boy is it ; like , windshield sun reflector size . 
sort of just a personal opinion review i suppose . 
very awesome item . 
really useful for tuning . 
have n't had any problems with it at all so far . 
looks very nice the snark series of tuners are the best small tuners i have found , i have both the the sn-1 and sn-2 for my guitar and mandolin respectively , when buying be sure to get the correct one for the instrument you are going to use it on , if not sure which , get the sn-2 -lrb- red -rrb- one it generally will work for all instruments . 
very very useful . 
like seriously , unless you are very very good , you can quickly get a sharper tuning with a snark than you can by ear . 
awesome tuner ! 
spot on tuning , very bright display and super fast and easy to use ! 
this is a must have this was for a friend who plays guitar . 
he used it several times and said that he was satisfied with the results . 
very useful . 
... even a kid can use it with a guitar . 
i received 2 in a kool metallic-blue , but as far as i know you ca n't choose the color and it is bad because a match with the instrument is kool.my perplexity -lrb- this is why the 4 stars -rrb- is generally on electronic tuning , it happened to me that different brands gave a slight different tune , while ` all ' should be perfect and perfectly the same ... creepy is n't it?what we do now ? 
i do not own a grand piano to decide which is the right tune ... better go back to the diapason ? 
i bought this as a second tuner for gigs . 
it is awesome!easy to use , easy to see . 
simple , inexpensive.get one ! 
you will not be disappointed . 
does what it says it does just as everyone elses reviews say it does so not a very helpful review here but i had to write something in order to give a rating love the very fast tracking , so convienient to have a cheap but amazing tuner on each of my guitars ! 
for $ 10 bux each , why not ??? the screen articulates so there is always a perfect view , i am finding myself making much more minor adjustments to my tuning than i used to just because its right there and so convienient , so my playing sounds better than ever before simply because i am always in perfect tune now ! 
way better than digging out the tuner from the case in the closet , finding a expensive 9 volt battery , selecting a note you want to tune and waiting for a needle to stop moving on my crappy old tuner . 
just an amazing product , i even clipped it onto my piano and bought a $ 30 set of tools online and saved $ 100 tuning my piano myself !!! 
this thing is awesome ! 
i think it 's the best tuner i 've owned and it really does an excellent job . 
it 's easy and clear and everything a tool should be . 
it 's fast and easy just like a tuner should be . 
this was a requested gift from my teenage son for christmas and you should 've seen the smile on his face that day . 
i purchased this tuner for my 9 year old who is beginning guitar and it is 100 % accurate and very easy to use . 
his guitar instructor also commented on how accurate and simple to use . 
i strongly suggest this to anyone looking for a tuner . 
he connects it to his electric guitar with out amplification and gets a tune and can be connected to the amp . 
if you are a beginner or seasoned player i know you will like an appreciate the tuner . 
a must to keep in your bag especially for beginners , a guitar out of tune is very difficult to learn on . 
what can i say ... for the price , this is the best tuner out there right now ! 
so nice not having to step on a tuning pedal in order to tune while i 'm gigging onstage . 
i just cut the volume on my guitar -lrb- snark senses vibrations through the neck ... so no sound needed ! -rrb- 
and i 'm done!tap tempo works great too if you need to know the tempo of a song ! 
just another awesome bonus :-rrb- works great right out of the box . 
easy to use and accurate . 
a must have for any guitar player . 
turn it on , clip it on and tune . 
this thing works great . 
tiny and seems to be accurate . 
the price is darn good as well . 
a must for all guitarists . 
i own a few tuners , including a boss tu-70 . 
recently i purchased and reviewed the new gogo tt-1 clip on tuner . 
i never thought a clip on could be as accurate and dependable as my boss . 
the gogo is awesome and instantly became the only tuner i use . 
but now i have to say , i think the snark is a little better . 
i bought the sn-1 and the sn-2 because they are so inexpensive and so amazingly accurate . 
the other great thing is they are chormatic , so besides being a great tuner , you can leave it clipped on to the headstock to practice accurate string bending or just learning the notes on the fretboard . 
the display is very easy to read ... better than the gogo -lrb- although gogo has a new improved display since i bought mine -rrb- . 
i love the colors and the matte finish too . 
the rubbery matte finish makes gripping the clip much easier than the smooth plastic of other tuners . 
the rubber surface also makes opening the battery compartment a snap too , i had to fight like heck to get the battery door open on my gogo . 
the snark is less than half the price of my gogo and out performs it ... it 's a no brainer . 
i used these on all my instruments , guitar , mandolin , and violin . 
it works fine and i would recommend them at this good price . 
for a while i had the sn-5 tuner . 
but i bought this one and i 'm glad a did . 
it 's fast , accurate , reliable . 
the product picture can be a little deceiving . 
the color is a a metallic blue -lrb- almost navy -rrb- . 
it 's got some good features although i do n't use them . 
i 'll use nothing but snarks ! 
i love this little guy . 
clip it on and no matter how much noise is around you , it will still accurately tune the guitar . 
very easy and simple to use . 
i paid $ 9 for it and it is 10 times better than the $ 40 one i have . 
i had been tuning my guitar by ear and thought i was doing a good job . 
after i used the snark my guitar sounds so much better . 
i will never be without one again . 
the snark is easy to use and shows you positively when the guitar is in tune . 
i like many things about this tuner . 
the fact that it turns off quicker than most and you only have to press the button to turn it off . 
unlike the fender which you have to press and hold . 
may not sound like a big deal but if you need to change tune in the middle of a show this one 's faster . 
the fender tuner in my opinion , and for my needs is more accurate and easier to see due to the fact that it gives a nice green color once you tune up . 
but this one 's cheaper . 
ahh decisions decisions . 
still , you ca n't go wrong either way . 
it does know when your guitar is in tune ! 
does it for you so you do n't have to do it by ear . 
i accidently ordered two of these , which proved fortunate because one did not have a battery when it arrived at my apo in afganistan , where watch batteries are hard to come by . 
that being said , this is the most user friendly little tuner i have ever owned . 
i do n't have a particularly good ear , but i can tell when i am out of tune , and i have struggled with other tuners in the past trying to get just the right tune . 
i bought this for a brand new backpack guitar , and i had the guitar tuned up in less than 5 minutes after i clamped this tuner on the neck . 
these are cheap enough to buy one for every guitar and keep it in the case . 
this tuner works great , easy to attach , turn on and adjusting the guitar to each individual string , is as easy as one two three . 
i popped the included battery into place , fired it up , clipped it to the head of my electric guitar , and it worked seamlessly . 
for the price , this is a great deal ! 
i 've been playing for over 30 years and now have three different electronic tuners , so i 'm a good judge of the snark : pros : it 's chromatic so it 's good for every tuning job ; no need to plug it into your jack ; ambient noise does n't effect it ; great sharp , colorful display ; reacts quickly ; small enough to fit easily in my case ; cool blue color ; built-in metronome ; powers down automatically to save the battery ; transposes up to four steps if you 're using a capo ; will even identify major chords.cons : works better on acoustics and semi-hollows than on solid bodied guitars ; made me realize that three of my strings need intonating -lrb- or is that a pro ? -rrb- 
; metronome is visual only ; manual says that long-term use of the clip in one spot can damage some guitars ' finishes ; big blue thing on your guitar looks weird.now that i have the snark i have officially retired my other two tuners . 
this is easier to use , easier to carry around , you do n't have to unplug from your amp , it works on acoustic or electric , and it 's chromatic . 
and it 's cheap . 
definitely recommended . 
bright easy to read display , adjusts to face any direction , so i can even use it with my telecaster which has very little room on the headstock . 
accurate and fast . 
ca n't beat the price , and battery compartment is easy to open , unlike some other tuners i have . 
started to take guitar lessons locally to balance out the dvd 's and books , and my teach used a clip-on tuner and my interest went sky high . 
-lrb- i am a professional drummer with serious guitar envy -rrb- all i can say is goodby jack-in tuners.with this little baby it makes no difference whether you are playing an electric guitar/bass or an acoustic , and you can tune on the fly with the thing clipped on to your headstock all the time . 
admittedly you can do this with with a jack-in tuner without the jack-in part , but the results are n't always that good , and you have to fish around for the tuner.the whole turn the amp down , unplug from the amp , jack into a tuner , unplug from the tuner , plug back into the amp , turn the amp up process every time something sounded a bit off always soured me and brought down my enthusiasm while practicing/playing the guitar , but those days are over . 
i need to keep my enthusiasm level high , and actually play the guitar instead of fishing around for a tuner.as far as accuracy , it is as good , or better than any jack-in tuner i have -lrb- i have three different brands -rrb- . 
when this arrived i did n't realize it was that small . 
thought it has to be so its out of the way . 
then i thought , this thing ca n't work very well , but it does perfectly . 
the first few times a used it , i was n't expecting muchhowever , i could n't more wrong it really works well and i would recommend this to family or friends . 
this tuner is easy to use . 
i have a guitar with a built in tuner that just does n't seem to be perfect on pitch . 
this tuner is and i am very happy with this purchase . 
who does n't love these tuners ? 
easy to use , easy to read , and has options that i do n't even use . 
highly recommend this . 
i have several different tunes , but the snark is hands down the fastest and most sensitive . 
has no trouble whatever picking up the low e-string on my seagull acoustic , which flummoxes my intelli 600 . 
having the tuner respond this quickly makes tuning go faster and easier . 
the only down side , and this is a matter of taste , is the garish color . 
you should n't leave these things on the headstock anyway as they can leave a mark , so the hideous color just encourages me to do the deed and put it away , which may be just as well . 
this little beast works great for guitars or basses in loud or soft environments . 
just clip it to your headstock and tune up in under 30 seconds . 
i 've even used it on the bell of my trumpet to tune up to pitch.pros : - dead-on accurate . 
you can easily set your intonation with this little monster . 
- works great in extremely loud environments . 
- clips on tightly . 
if you do n't jump around like an orangutan on stage , you could probably have the snark ride your headstock through the whole show . 
- you do n't have to plug into it . 
- extremely responsive . 
- enough display detail for you to know when you 're getting close to in tune -- not just 3 indicators like some tuners -lrb- flat , dead-on , sharp -rrb- . 
- very inexpensive.cons : - a little twitchy on the open low b string on bass . 
i use the 12th fret harmonics -lrb- first partial -rrb- to tune , however , since it 's a purer tone that seems to resonate in the headstock more , so this has never really been a problem for me.inexpensive enough to keep one in every gig bag or case -- for every instrument you own . 
i bought this to replace the inexpensive musedo t-50 tuner that came bundled with my kala ka-s ukulele . 
the snark sn-2 is much more accurate , but its lcd display is not very bright , and has a narrow field of view . 
-lrb- yes , i did try a fresh battery , but it made no difference . -rrb- 
i wish it were brighter and easier to see . 
still , it 's a very good tuner overall . 
this is just the tuner i was looking for ! 
it works on vibration or mic , so it 's very versatile . 
it works on my acoustic , bass , electric , and my mother 's voice . 
have n't tried the trumpet yet ... intuitive and the back-lit screen is so easy to see ! 
this tuner is very accurate . 
it is well made and stays on without falling off . 
i tested it with other tuners and it 's right on . 
easy to see when positioned correctly . 
it is bright , easy to attach to my guitar but there are some problems with it being so `` fragile '' at the base . 
the battery was a bit tricky to insert since it is so close to the base . 
i like the swivel but it is delicate since it is plastic . 
be careful not to twist it around quickly or it might snap off . 
it is very sensitive and has been more accurate than a planet waves tuner i currently own . 
would i buy it again ? 
i do n't know . 
going to see if it durable and if it continues to be accurate . 
looks ok on your guitar and it is not in the way . 
i bought this tuner mainly for my acoustic guitar ; i have a sabine tuner with a mini-mike but unplugging the tuner from my amp , having the room completely quiet and the tuner in a good position is a couple of extra steps i 'd rather not go through . 
this tuner is compact and works well ; i clip it onto whatever guitar i pick up for a quick tune -lrb- acoustic or electric -rrb- , push the power button , and off i go . 
i have n't fooled with the other features -lrb- metronome ? 
detuning ? -rrb- 
, so i ca n't comment about them . 
an added comment : i broke off one of the flimsy little tabs that holds onto the ball joint from it being overextended . 
my fault , but it should n't have broken so easily . 
i 'm sure they could make the plastic tabs just a wee bit stronger/thicker , or make it so it pops out of the joint when overextended instead of breaking completely . 
i bought this tuner primarily for my wife who plays harp -lrb- i play guitar -rrb- . 
she has been using my guitar tuner which works okay but cumbersome . 
i was hoping this tuner would clip on the top of the harp to make it easier for her.unfortunately , it does n't fit on top of our harp . 
the tuner is rather small which is nice for transporting but the clip will not open wide enough for the top of the harp . 
it does , however , clip into the sound hole okay.it tunes the harp fairly well . 
i only had problems with the top 3-4 strings which i had to pluck a bit harder for the tuner to pick up.i also tried it on my acoustic guitar and it did the job perfectly . 
-lrb- clipped it to the top of the headstock -rrb- tracking is very , very good for a tuner at this price . 
i was able to play the strings , tune them , and watch the meter follow the note . 
display is very easy to read and lights up nicely . 
i was tuning in a dim-lit room and was able to read it perfectly . 
i 'm sure it would be great on a dark stage.the only other drawback is that the display needs to be positioned within a certain range . 
otherwise it gets a big hard to read . 
but positioning it is very simple since it swivels easily .4 out 5 only because of size -lrb- not fitting on harp as i hoped -rrb- and display legibility depending on angle -lrb- i had to reposition it maybe 2 times in order to tune the whole harp -rrb- . 
the tuner works well in both mic and vibration mode . 
the screen could be a little brighter . 
otherwise , no complaints . 
i received my tuner yesterday very fast shipping , it looks great , the price is right , but most of all it works wonderful , very easy to use and small enough to carry in my guitar case . 
i first used the snark when i borrowed a friends before a show , and i thought it was the coolest thing in the world . 
he used it to tune his acoustic electric , and at first i thought it was working off of sound , but then i put it on the headstock of my unplugged electric , and it picked it up instantly , and tuned it perfectly . 
i could n't beleive it . 
i had to have one . 
i ordered the one that is capable of both miced tuning , and vibration tuning , as well has having the tap beat metronome , and i am in love with it . 
it 's so sensitive , and so accurate , you can turn the mic off , and use it to tune your electric guitar in a very loud room , and it wo n't pick up ambient noises . 
love it love it love it . 
i recommend this to all musicians . 
the mic feature would be useful on your music stand , or attached to your trumpet , tuba , saxophone , whatever ... clamp it on , and play . 
absolutely awesome . 
this is the second one i buy and i love it , is small , fast and accurate , best of all , you do n't need to have the volume knob open for tuning , i bough this one as a birthday present for a friend and i know is inexpensive , but it feel quality and does it job perfectly , my friend love it above all the other gift , it is a everyday use tool for a musician . 
i highly recommend these tuners . 
they are the best i have found for fiddle and mandolin . 
they also work well with acoustical guitar . 
great precise tuning with the sn-2 versus the other snark versions . 
i would only go with the sn-2 . 
but ... like all the snarks , they are delicate where the head attaches at the ball joint . 
treat it gently and find a hardshell plastic case in which to keep it and transport it or it will get smashed and break apart . 
i have several tuners . 
one is an inline tuner , one built into my amp ... etc. . . 
this is my favorite go to tuner . 
it 's fast and accurate . 
every one in my band uses this tuner . 
it works for guitar and bass . 
it 's easy to read and dead on ... . 
it works . 
it is cheap . 
it does the job well . 
a review mentioned it did n't come with batteries . 
mine came with batteries . 
i highly recommend it as do all of the other reviews . 
tuner works great . 
both by vibration and mic.only real problem is the fact that the joint between the tuner and the clip is really weak . 
mine broke off ... not even a year old . 
extreamly easy to use , you can tune any instrumet witn this . 
the display is bright and clear , easy to see in the dark . 
you can tune by sound with the microphone or by vibration ; the clip is excellent to hold it to the instrument . 
the price could n't be better , i just ca n't believe how come people purchase a lot more expensive tuners when this excellent product exists . 
this is without a doubt the best guitar tuner i have ever used . 
i have been playing for years and have owned many tuners , this one is the best and i purchased it at a better price than it was offered at my local music store . 
i 've played guitars for over 40 years , and i 've owned or used many , many tuners - stompbox , rack-mount , etc. . 
this is a great tuner . 
i bought a clip-on tuner about 10 years ago when they were first becoming popular . 
it was ok - fairly accurate , very convenient , but it 's sensitivity would make it difficult to tune the low e . 
this snark is much better . 
i compared it to my boss tu-2 -lrb- which is the standard stompbox tuner of gigging musicians -rrb- , and it 's just about as accurate . 
the fact that it 's chromatic means you can tune to any note , which is useful for non-standard tunings . 
it even has a built-in mic for situations where you ca n't clip it on -lrb- say , for a lap-steel guitar -rrb- . 
the head swivels to just about any position , and its sensitivity allows you to tune in live situations when other instruments are playing . 
the only reason i give it 4 stars rather than 5 is that because of its curved `` arm '' it 's a little awkward to pack for traveling - if you were to cram it into a space and there was some pressure on it i could see the arm possibly breaking off from the spring part . 
so , to me , outside of that -lrb- and the fact that it only comes in red so far -rrb- , it 's perfect . 
this tuner is way better than my earlier tunners which relied on either sound to their microphone , or direct plug in for electric instruments . 
this has the microphone feature , but is better used with the clip on vibration mode . 
just clip it on to your guitar head , and hit the string . 
a multicolored display shows if you are sharp or flat . 
easy to use . 
it is easy to use and it tunes multiple instruments . 
it works better than my piano . 
i can trust that i will be in tune . 
the design of this product is innovative and excellent . 
i have n't used it for as long as i would generally like before writing amazon reviews of purchased items , and so can not testify to its reliability , but suffice to say that , for the price , it would be hard to beat.the display is very clear , and the ability to clip to your headstock while tuning is marvelous . 
i wonder how i ever lived without it before.for live gigs playing electric , i would prefer a floor tuner running through a pedal board with a patch cable , as noisy environments probably would n't be ideal for this tuner . 
this is more for your parlor acoustic setup . 
this is a great tuner . 
high quality construction . 
the tuning is accurate . 
the controls are easy to use and the dial is easy to read . 
it is far superior to a fishman tuner that i bought previously . 
the fishman controls did not work properly and the tuning was not accurate . 
these tuners are very handy to make quick tuning corrections while playing . 
this is a very versatile tuner ! 
i use it all the time to check my instruments , and keep things sounding good . 
highly recommend this product . 
much better than similarly priced products out there for tuning . 
i ca n't recommend this enough and the battery last a long time ! 
i have n't had to change mine in almost two years since i 've had it ! 
just a great overall tuner . 
great for carrying with you . 
works as it should . 
good price . 
i would recommend it if you need a table top mic stand or one just off the floor about a foot . 
this was so inexpensive i could n't pass it up.i needed a short stand to mic kick drums for recordings and this fit the bill exactly.folds up quite small and comes with the carrying bag . 
i just toss it in my gig bag and i 'm always ready . 
-lsb- ... -rsb- i really like this cable ! 
maybe it 's not top quality but it feels solid to me and works just fine . 
i keep it attached to my little practice amp and play a few feet away . 
it probably stretches 10-12 feet if you really need it too . 
what i really like is that it 's compact and i do n't have cables laying all over the floor.overall it 's a solid cable for practice . 
i 'll buy more . 
i bought this cable long with my epiphone les paul special ii and the fender mini tone master thinking that either one did not come with a cable . 
the epiphone came with a cable which ceased functioning after a couple days . 
the curly cable has fared much better . 
no problems , works great and does n't tangle so it stores easily too.great as a primary or backup cable . 
buy one , it 's cheap ! 
i got the irig thinking i 'd use it for performance , but he app leaves somthing to be desired . 
i had a very hard time fining a tone i could live with , plus , once you add any of the virtual pedals , the feedback was rediculous . 
all that needs to be said is that &#34; it 's a peterson &#34; just the best tuner 's ever . 
i also use one on my pedal board , would n't use anything else !!!!!! this mxl studio 24 usb microphone is a decent choice for those needing a portable or a good quality studio microphone . 
we professionally produce instructional videos , both at our shop and at customer locations , and often need to voice over footage . 
this mic will replace theblue microphones snowball usb microphone -lrb- textured white -rrb- we use in studio and also themxl mics mxl-studio 1 usb condenser microphone , cardioidwe had previously used for off-site recording.pros - * good voice quality ; cleanly captures spoken voices * good physical quality ; this is beefy mic that feels very well made * looks professional ; while not important to the functionality , it makes a good impression on our customers * long usb cord ; allows for placement away from pc * headphone jack ; `` real time monitor '' , handy to listen to live recording and playback * travels well ; includes a protective travel case that fits all of componentscons - * no pop-filter included ; normally i would n't mention this but the instructions include a warning the condenser mics are susceptible to water damage -lrb- like from breath moisture -rrb- and a pop-filter is `` essential '' . 
we boughtnady mpf-6 6-inch clamp on microphone pop filter * left channel ; only brings in audio on the left channel , had to compensate in my editing softwaremisc - * since we do not do music recording of any type , i ca n't comment on the mic 's performance in that area * software ; studio control gui -lrb- downloadable -rrb- can be launched to control some of the finer functions of the microphone , but the interface is not intuitive and my editing software -lrb- sony vegas pro -rrb- gives me better control for what we dothe mxl studio 24 mic more than meets our needs -lrb- which may be different from yours -rrb- . 
recommended!cfh this microphone only records in mono , and if you 're unsure of what that means , it does n't capture sound to it 's full potential , and does n't create a left/right feeling . 
all recordings sound like it is coming from just one direction , and though this is useful for some things such as podcasts , i would n't recommend it to a musician looking for great voice quality . 
it looks nice , and it would b e great for a skype call , but it really was n't what i was expecting when i opened the box up and tested it out . 
if you 're looking for a mono microphone , this is however a very good mono microphone . 
this is an intriguing idea for a microphone : a nice condenser with built-in monitoring . 
a possible simple solution for the musician who really wants to keep a rig minimal . 
it seemed to me that i should test it both as a microphone and as a usb io device . 
the very first appearance is impressive . 
there 's a nicely-compartmentalized carrying case . 
inside , there 's a milled aluminum desk stand , a cable , a short manual and the microphone . 
no shock mount . 
the mic looks good , but has almost no mass . 
while this may not mean much , i own and have used lots of mics -- none of them this lacking in heft.i set up a shootout in my studio . 
i have an acoustically-treated room with calibrated studio monitors , so i think i can do a fair test . 
i kept it simple , using a steel string guitar played in several styles . 
for a comparison mic , i used an akg perception 420 . 
this is a multipattern mic that 's only a little more expensive ; a cardiod-only version is exactly the same price as this mxl . 
i used only the cardiod pattern , so i think it 's a fair comparison on the basis of price . 
to get to the point , the akg beat the mxl in every way . 
it was quieter , with a much better midrange . 
a glance at the specs -lrb- online at mxl -rrb- shows a significant boost in higher frequencies , leading to about a 3db rise at 8k or so . 
the polar pattern is shown only in broadband -lrb- not at multiple frequencies -rrb- and it shows a dip at the 45-degree position . 
these were things i could easily hear.so purely as a microphone , the mxl does n't match up to other mics in its price range . 
but that 's not a complete comparison . 
the mxl has a little headphone jack on the side so that the performer can listen with zero latency . 
that 's a plus that comes with a couple of big minuses . 
the mic is vulnerable to cable scrapes and vibrations coming down the headphone cable -- better make sure you hold still when you use it . 
there 's also a volume knob that appears to effect both listening and recording level . 
this means that it 's easy to inadvertently skew recording levels when you 're mounting the mic or tweaking your listening level.there 's also an optional software control panel -lrb- mac and windows -rrb- that goes with the mic . 
it provides a noise gate and compressor as long as some basic controls for recording and monitoring . 
i 'm unlikely ever to use this dynamics processing ; once done , it ca n't be undone . 
i 'd apply those after the fact when i 've got plenty of time to dial them in . 
this leaves the level controls -- a place where mxl could have been more careful . 
there 's a microphone gain which works in conjunction with the thumbwheel on the mic itself . 
it takes some doing to figure out which does what . 
there 's a highpass filter -- tremendously useful when rumble is a problem . 
but we do n't know if this filter is in the analog or digital domain . 
i hope it 's analog , but there 's nothing about it in the documentation . 
then there 's the biggest problem . 
there 's a playback level control which allows your mix to play back through the mic 's headphone jack . 
but this also means that -- depending on your daw -- it 's easy to set up a feedback path . 
you wo n't like that.the biggest question in my mind is `` just who is this microphone for '' ? 
a traditional mic can be connected to any preamp and used at any sample rate . 
i have mics -lrb- both expensive and inexpensive -rrb- that i 've had for years and years . 
only the preamp/interface changes . 
this mxl is usb-only , 44/48 only . 
you ca n't easily set up multiples of usb mics without clocking issues . 
most usb/firewire mic preamps have a zero-latency monitoring mode , so the mic does n't really offer anything you ca n't get elsewhere . 
in the end , i do n't really think this is a good choice for any but the most casual of musicians . 
to me , that milled aluminum desk mount holds the answer . 
if you 're a podcaster or a serious skyper , then this mic deserves consideration . 
it 's a decent mic for spoken voice -- the hf boost is helpful in bringing out articulation -- and the single usb connection keeps your desk uncluttered . 
of course , there are plenty of other choices for that application . 
but i think that 's the best light to shine on this one . 
i was using a joyo power supply and when i bought my fuzz i ran out of plugs so i bought this . 
it does the job . 
i plan on getting a couple of the juniors next since i only have 1 18v pedal and the rest are 9 's its a must have for guitarist with multi effects . 
it comes with a range of wires but i did not like that you camt use the last two ports together -lrb- the ac ports -rrb- . 
other than that it good this is an amazing guitar . 
i could n't put it down , i have experience playing really , really expensive guitars . 
my $ 500 `` beater '' acoustic i was just going to take to the beach and stuff actually got warped and never played well at all , i could n't imagine what i would b getting for $ 90 . 
by was i wrong . 
it 's my best acoustic currently ! 
this thing sounds like , sustains , and holds its ' own tune like a similar $ 2000.00 + martin model and that 's zero exaggeration ! 
get it and see , you will be blown away . 
i bought a second one . 
i just wish i had found this guitar sooner . 
this is a good beginner or intermediate guitar but if you play for profit get something better . 
cheap case but does at least fit the guitar . 
i like it but i 'm just playing for entertainment and at church some times . 
electronics are just volume , and tone but it rocks my little battery powered honeytone amp . 
nice finish , nice guitar . . 
for the money ; -rrb- a well-designed strap that looks and works really nice . 
i 'd say it 's a little expensive . 
they should cut the price down by at least 1/3 and it would be a 5 star rating . 
for the price and affect itself u can not get a better deal.use it for my acoustic guitar pedal board though . 
it just does the job and im more than satisfied.it works awesome with electric guitar too . 
just get it ! 
was a little hesitant to get a stomp pedal , especially a delay , for this price . 
but i figured , how can you go wrong ... if it 's not good , at least you 're not out a lot of money . 
i 've been thoroughly impressed with this pedal . 
much more sturdy than it appears in photos . 
i actually like that the input and output jacks are at the front of it . 
works great so far and do n't regret purchasing ... worth every dime ... where else can you get a great-functioning delay pedal for this price ? 
people tell you you need to buy a 1000 dollar tube amp to sound good . . 
shuuut up . . 
mic this through a pa and you ; re set never need another amp againuse amp modeling software that fender includes and you have a vast array of tones . . 
for 100 bucks . . 
spend money on a top end guitar if you get this amp its all you need i got mine in a trade for practically nothing . 
i figured i could sell it and make a few bucks , saw the mustang amp around but never gave it any credibility , looked like a toy to me . 
anyway i decided to plug it in and was shocked at the full sound of the little 8 inch speaker . 
i researched and found there is a program called fuse that can interface with the amp . 
i downloaded and linked to the amp , there i saw you can make a lot of changes that ca n't be done with just the knobs . 
i saw it had a deluxe reverb setting . 
i have the deluxe reverb reissue so dialed in the same settings with the fuse software . 
to my amazement it sound like a smaller version of my deluxe ! 
fender really got close with the modeling . 
i went ahead and programmed a few more patches and set up a footswitch to change between 2 settings . 
i liked it so much i went out and bought the mustang ii . 
i almost like the mustang i better but the ii does have enough power to gig with if you are n't a loud band . 
i will leave my deluxe reverb at home for my next small gig and use the mustang , maybe even the little one and mic it up . . 
this is really a great amp for the price . 
if you 're new to electric guitar , and you want an amp to get started , buy this one . 
it has incredible versatility , and you can get started with trying out a huge range of different sounds without having to invest in a variety of effects and different amps.i got much more than i expected for the price of this amp . 
i really like the bassman and twin reverb settings.i wo n't claim that you can buy this amp and never have need for something bigger , better , vintage tube , etc. , but this will more than meet your needs to use at home . 
buy the 20w version , which is plenty loud for home . 
later - when you have the skills to justify it , start buying some tube equipment . 
this amp will help you figure out what tones you like for the music you want to play.i considered various new/used amps in the same price range , and i 'm extremely happy i picked this one . 
if you came by my house with some other brand new amp that cost twice as much as this and wanted to trade me , i 'd tell you to go away . 
but if you stop by with a nice twin reverb , i 'd give up my mustang ... but then i 'd go buy another one . 
i love small amps and have played many of them over the last 25 years . 
i still own a few , my favorite being the first super champ from the early '80s ; rivera nailed that one . 
i naturally prefer tubes for that true tone , but tried one of these out last year at a pal 's place and was sold within two minutes . 
i bought one six months ago and after playing it almost daily since then i can say without doubt that this is the most versatile solid state practice amp i 've ever used.for the money it 's a crazy deal . 
i have never once used the included online stuff or the ableton software , so those add even more value to this package , no doubt . 
all i wanted was a warm up amp with real tone , and this is that and plenty more . 
my all-time favorite tone is the clean glassy fender late - '50s / early '60s sound , typified by the bassmans and twins and deluxes of the pre-cbs era . 
that tone needs tubes to really sing , but to my amazement the amp modeling of this mustang comes amazingly close to that sound without tubes . 
you 'll always miss that tube sag but the crispness and snap is all there , especially on the bassman settings . 
my strats sound so damn good through this on clean settings , and my prs absolutely smokes with real lease-breaking volume on super-sonic -lrb- dial the gain way back for a nice low-throttle roar -rrb- . 
having gain , volume and master lets you dial in a ton of tones with each amp model , and the two separate effects knobs let you add chorus/tremolo etc plus various reverbs/delays etc , though i find myself keeping everything totally clean as time goes by ; if i ca n't get the tone i want with my fingers then i need to learn how to is my motto . 
and this amp is so accurate that i can.above all , this mustang is musical . 
for a small amp that 's a real feat , but for 100 clams it 's a near miracle . 
add a built in tuner -lrb- the most useful `` extra '' any amp can have -rrb- , good effects , great amp models , the software and more online amp models -lrb- which i 'll get around to one day but so far i get all the tone i need from the amp as it is -rrb- , plus 20 watts for lots of headroom , and this is a straight up steal for a bill.the only thing missing is serious bass at volume , but this is an 8 after all , not a 10 , so you 'll always miss some of the real bottom . 
but what 's there is solid and tight and only craps out at top volume ; only with a rock drummer will you need more roar than this provides . 
you could easily do quiet jazz and folk gigs with this puppy.all told , the mustang i is easily not only the best value practice amp of them all out there now -lrb- crate and line 6 etc do n't come close -rrb- , but paired with a mini-strat this would be the absolutely perfect beginner 's set up for a kid looking to play anything from the beatles to metallica and everything in between.can ' t recommend this highly enough to anyone who thinks real tone ca n't come in a small solid state amp . 
it can , it does , and it 's cheaper than i can still believe.fender truly went to 11 on this one.leo would be proud ! 
it 's been a while since last we got together . 
the old amps we had were way too big . 
for me this one is just right.fender mustang i electric guitar amplifier originally put-off by the low price , i went with the reviews . 
simply awesome ! 
this amp is packed with features . 
beginner/intermediate level player would be very pleased ! 
the best part is , it 's not at all complex to learn the features . 
when i bought this it was n't the amp i wanted but because of budget and reviews i picked it . 
i could n't be happier . 
this little amp really impressed me . 
add fender fuse software and its probably the best $ 99 i 've spent in a while well , just got it , plugged in and here are some initial impressions .1 . 
pretty much what i expected - much more `` relaxed '' at higher volumes than the m1 .2 . 
definitely much bigger and fuller sounding with its commensurate drawbacks . 
- slightly less naturally sparkly compared to the m1 - will have to reduce the mids a bit via the fuse editor . 
- although it has less overall sparkle , that also translates to smoother highs . 
i was actually a bit hard pressed to get it to sound buzzy . 
this is of course via the front panel only . 
i 'm sure it can be done using the fuse editor .3 . 
it 's supposed to be 7 lbs . 
heavier than the m1 but it sure does n't feel like it . 
i keep looking at the m1 fiendishly wondering if there 's a way to shoehorn a 12 '' speaker in there .4 . 
for the most part , the patches created in the m1 translated pretty well after the required firmware update , needing just a few adjustments here and there .5 . 
i 'm appreciative of the fuller more naturally extended low end as i wo n't have to crank the bass control as much as i have to on the m1 . 
that of course translates to more headroom for the power amp.more from editing via fuse - here are a few of the things that i found and liked . 
- the 65 deluxe model sounds better with the 57 deluxe 's cab and vice versa . 
the 65 has more headroom and works great as a clean spanky amp with the 57 's cab while the 57 model 's propensity to break up sooner works better with the 65 's less sparkly cab . 
the 57 also seems to have more low end girth . 
- the twin is a bit too icepick-y sometimes and it seems to pair better with the bassman 's cab . 
- the supersonic 's cab is a bit more muted at the top end than any of the other cabs and works well for sounds i use that have a bit more gain . 
it 's good for keeping things from getting too buzzy . 
it 's a very fat sounding cab sim . 
- both the m1 and 2 seem to respond really well with my tex-mex pickups . 
i have not played a guitar with regular sized humbuckers on these amps yet -lrb- my other guitar has mini humbuckers -rrb- but somehow i get the feeling that i wo n't like it as much as i do with the strat . 
i think this is understandable though . 
since fender has always been all about the single coils , i 'm not surprised that the impedance relationship between these amps and my strat feels so spot on.so far , for 200 bucks ... i could n't ask for more . 
for those unfamiliar with vox 's amplug products , these things are amazing . 
i 'm just old enough to remember some of the portable options of the 1990 's , and they were mostly terrible . 
what vox has done with these tiny headphone amplifiers -lrb- which weigh virtually nothing , run for 10-15 hours on 2 aaa batteries , and plug directly into the guitar -rrb- is nothing short of amazing . 
they have incredible amp-like tone and get as loud as you can possibly want . 
even through a pair of $ 20 sony headphones , they sound amazing . 
the star of the collection , in my opinion , is the vox ac30 amplug , which does a great vintage tube amp ranging from sparkling cleans to top boost overdrive . 
if you have n't played an amplug before , the ac30 one is $ 39.99 of the best money you 'll ever spend.now , getting to this specific joe satriani amplug , it 's impossible to talk about the tone without talking about the guitarist himself . 
fans of joe satriani -lrb- even casual ones -rrb- will recognize elements of this sound right away . 
satriani has a very distinctive sound , which he crafted over the years using a modified boss ds-1 distortion and -lrb- more recently -rrb- his vox `` satchurator '' distortion box . 
it 's a thick lead tone with a nice sustain , and colored with a delay affect . 
both of those elements are present on this signature amplug . 
you have a level control , a gain control , and a tone control . 
there 's also three switch positions : off , on , and fx . 
the `` fx '' position engages the delay affect , but the tone is otherwise the same.pros : first , the price retails at $ 49.99 , whereas most of the other models are $ 39.99 . 
-lrb- i believe the lead amplug is also $ 49.99 and also has a delay feature -rrb- . 
i think that the added delay feature and unique tone are worth the extra money , but this is admittedly a sort of `` niche '' product . 
overall , however , you have several amplugs to choose from , and if you choose this one , $ 49.99 is still an incredible value for the ability to play your guitar virtually anywhere and enjoy quality tone . 
the tone has a real sweet spot between `` 3 '' and `` 5 '' that really makes it enjoyable to play lead notes . 
while it is n't necessarily and `` ideal '' rhythm guitar distortion , you can hit rich chords with nice sustain . 
i prefer the tone on the higher gain levels , and you can really crank it up if you want to , but it sounds great at lower volumes too . 
the delay is also surprisingly good - it 's probably set to around the 400 milisecond gap , which is pretty standard . 
adds a cool echo `` fullness '' to your solo progressions , much like a classic satriani solo . 
again , the overall tone is fantastic . 
with the amount of gain provided , you can play most types of rock and dabble into metal guitar a bit -lrb- though i 've always thought of satch of more a technical , melodic guitarist than a `` metal '' guitarist -rrb- . 
cons : there are a few things to know about the satriani signature model , but i do n't think any of them should discourage you from checking it out . 
while the delay is surprisingly good , you ca n't customize it . 
you ca n't make the repeats shorter or longer , and you ca n't adjust the timing of the repeats . 
keep in mind that this is mostly a `` practice '' device for your personal use , however , and i still enjoy using the delay . 
as for the tone , which i mostly discussed as a `` pro '' in the paragraph above , you should be aware that this is not meant to be a `` clean '' signal . 
it is possible to get a somewhat clean tone by rolling back on the gain or lowering the volume of your guitar , but it 's mostly distortion or bust . 
the durability of all of the amplugs has also been questioned by some . 
the device is very lightweight and all plastic , accept for the metal plug portion . 
i do n't doubt that you could bang it on something and break it quite easily . 
the switches and dials may also fail over time . 
but frankly , at $ 40 or $ 50 , it 's probably a better value than making it out of heavy duty metal and charging $ 100 for it , which would lock more people out of the market . 
i would certainly buy another one -lrb- or several -rrb- if any of mine broke . 
finally , there as an audible `` hiss '' noise through your headphones anytime the device is on . 
slightly annoying when you 're not playing , but i do n't notice it at all once i start playing notes.the verdict : one other `` dirty little secret '' to point out about these things : in addition to the aux jack , which allows you to plug in an mp3 player and jam along , it is possible to use a 1/8 '' to 1/4 '' adapter and audio cable to plug this thing directly into an amp , pa , or anything with speakers . 
you might be surprised how good it sounds.as an after-note , i wrote most of this review playing on my jackson dr6 , which has two seymour duncan humbuckers , and it sounded great . 
i later tried it on a gibson les paul -lrb- which is usually my primary guitar -rrb- , and despite the fact it also has two humbuckers , it did not sound as good . 
the distortion was much more `` fizzy '' . 
have n't tried it with single coil pickups , but i think that it would likely work well with a strat-type guitar due to the overall `` roundness '' of the tone.the amplug is a great invention that allows so many players to log endless hours practicing , irrespective of their budget or living situation . 
the satriani model brings its own special character to the series , and if you like the tone as much as i do , might become an instant favorite . 
first off this costs extra because of the drum pads which are pretty much useless . 
you have to practically hit them with a hammer to get a response . 
the keyboard feel flimsy and they are indeed small and not very playable . 
there is no modulation wheel but you do get crappy unresponsive pads and cheap knobs . 
hate the mini usb jack since those connections rarely last . 
for this price it is a ` do not recommend ' for me . 
this tuner looks nice , and works great . 
it puts guitars into the best tune . 
it has lasted for over a year and the battery has n't died yet . 
some might say it breaks easily but as long as it is dealt with gently there will be no problems . 
great price , great tuner , worth the buy . 
easy to use . 
i can tune while in a sea of people or other musical background . 
this is definitely more accurate than a person 's ear while other instruments are playing . 
i have countless delay pedals and racks . 
this inexpensive delay is very special . 
it has the tone and mojo of an analog delay . 
it wo n't give you a thousand features but it will get you close to that rich vintage analog delay tone that many of us are looking for . 
it sounds great clean or dirty . 
it 's a relatively short delay , which is great for many genres . 
long delays are generally unusable accept for very short passages at the end of a phrase or surreal eric johnson like music . 
i would qualify this as a working musicians delay that can be used in the studio and in a live environment . 
it 's bring an atmosphere of surrealism without going overboard , to your music . 
pair it with a nice fuzz or overdrive and you 'll be near the dark side of the moon . 
many musicians use two delay pedals . 
i know , i often do . 
this one is my main delay and my 2nd delay is a very expensive feature rich stereo delay that is a bit sterile and only sees occasional usage . 
both work together to help me find the tones that i am searching for . 
the unit itself seems sturdy and well made . 
i use carbon zinc batteries in mine . 
they just seem to sound better to my ears . 
keep it unplugged when not in use and it lasts a long time.true bypass and no hiss . 
great surprise as i never took rogue seriously . 
never thought it 'd be my goto pedal . 
i have a collection of guitars that exceeds well over 100 . 
i have guitars that cost thousands of dollars and i also have some cheapies . 
some of the best sounding and best playing guitars are the `` cheapies '' i 've been dealing with musician 's friend forever . 
rogue is musician 's friend 's brand . 
music 123 is a musician 's friend affiliate and they also sell rogue guitars . 
i have several different models of rogue guitars and i 'm impressed with all of them . 
the rogue ra-090 is an entry level dreadnought acoustic guitar which is every bit as good if not better than the fender starcaster . 
here 's the good part , the rogue is about half the price of the fender ! 
many people think they want to learn to play a guitar until they get one . 
once they realize it 's not as easy as they thought and it hurts thier fingers , they quickly lose interest and the guitar gets stored under the bed to soon be forgotten . 
if you 're not sure if you 're serious about learning to play , this is the guitar for you . 
even if you 're an intermediate to advanced player , you still ca n't go wrong with this guitar . 
it has a deep rich tone like that of a much more expensive instrument . 
the finish and workmanship is also like what you 'd find on a more expensive guitar . 
they look , play and sound great ! 
many people tend to shy away from rogue guitars because of the low price . 
they figure a guitar that cheap ca n't be much good . 
that 's where they 're wrong ! 
you have to actually play one to understand what i 'm talking about . 
once you play a rogue guitar , you too , will become a believer . 
this is the kind of guitar you can take camping to play around the campfire . 
if it happens to get damaged or stolen you 're not out an arm and a leg . 
i love fender guitars and they are among some of my favorites , but for an entry level dreadnought acoustic guitar , the rogue is a much better value than the fender and equal if not better in quality . 
the rogue ra-090 comes in a variety of color choices . 
if or when you decide to sell it , you can usually get back what you paid for it.i give rogue guitars my highest recommendation and promise you will not be disappointed it you buy one . 
i 've been playing guitar for 51 years so i should know what i 'm talking about . 
i do not own stock in musician 's friend , music 123 , or rogue guitars and i do n't get paid to endorse them . 
this review is my honest opinion . 
i have played it with the strings it came with and as a guitarist for 20 years i can attest to the fact that this is a great practice guitar or for taking to the james river . 
i used to take my $ 700 ibanez electric acoustic down to that river and it was sometimes a scary thing . 
the ibanez is heavy where this rogue is light as a feather and it did not cost a lot of money . 
i want at least one more of these to carry around with me everywhere i go . 
when it dies i will buy another one . 
you can not use this for performance of any kind , but for yourself , friends and family around the campsite or wherever , it is perfect ! 
been playing for 30 years and i have used tube screamers extensively . 
as some of the other reviewers have noted this is basically a tube screamer clone without the annoying midrange hump which some people complain about . 
it is reasonably quiet and is built with reasonably good components . 
most importantly it sounds quite good especially when you take into account that it cost a bit over 30 dollars . 
are there better tube screamer clones out there ? 
probably but for the price you will not find a better unit . 
build sturdy , i would gig with this without hesitation.i hate to leave this review because i know the prices will go up on the joyo stuff as more people are tuned into these products . 
great pedal . 
great value . 
yep , i said it , better than a tubescreamer.this pedal has a wider gain range , far wider tone range and is much quieter than my mid 80s ` screamer.the only thing it seems to lack is the &#34; smooth creaminess &#34; of an old 808 , but i can easily live with that . . 
this is an amazing ts clone , and for the price , cant be beat . 
i swear this sound just ass good if not slightly better then my ole ts-9 tube screamer . 
you wont regret this purchase the issue is n't whether it sounds exactly like a &#34; tube screamer &#34; , the issue -lrb- for me at least -rrb- is , does it sound good ? 
is it musical ? 
does it sound like an overdriven amp?i say it does . 
it sounds great for blues and rock . 
i 've only had it for a couple weeks and i hope that it continues to work well for a long time . 
i 've heard that these can be fragile , but i 'm pretty gentle with my gear . 
if it breaks , i 'll post about it . 
despite being so small , it will fill most rooms completely ! 
these are lasers ! 
you can buy one of those cheapo keychain sized lasers and those go for miles so you know this thing will deliver . 
the patterns they go in are mesmerizing no matter the pace . 
i have n't tested the sound-feature but i 've seen it on videos . 
i recommend this to anyone want to be entertained ! 
this is the american dj micro galaxian red & green laser . 
it is the smaller version of the galaxian laser with the same laser power output , but a smaller beam spread . 
it is a compact well built unit with a power switch on the back and a small fan to keep it cool . 
the small power cord plugs into the back of the unit and has a transformer block on the end of the cord . 
it comes with a remote that works great , but has an antenna to pull up if needed , which seems like old technology . 
the remote has 4 buttons which allows you to select auto/sound mode , blackout , color and direction of rotation . 
when going through the color modes you can select red , green , red/green together or red/green changing and flashing . 
you can select auto mode or sound mode so it will go with the music . 
there is also a speed control knob on the back of the laser to have the dots stop completely , move very fast or slow . 
the darker the room the better , but you can easily see it in any room with the lights on . 
i am very pleased with it . 
i havent tried it with fog but i know it would look great since it has 200 beams . 
it will work great for any dj to use on the dancefloor , wall or ceiling . 
this is a great buy under $ 100 . 
pros : it is small , bright , well built and works great . 
it has a remote to control it.cons : transformer on cord and antenna on remote . 
i got this to help clean my strings after constant playing to help preserve them and keep them from having oils from my fingers cause them to fail . 
saves some money on replacements ... i found another product that actually gets the top and bottom for a better cleaning of the strings so i like it better as far as the whole purpose of cleaning the strings . 
i use this to apply my cleaner to the fingerboard now for a deeper cleaning . 
this is an even easier sting cleaner than the round tin cleaner that 's been around . 
it 's better because it cleans all 6 at once . 
i requested and received one of these as a christmas gift , then bought another so i could keep the first one at a weekend place where i keep a guitar . 
it works quickly and easily to swipe on the strings , and keeps strings clean and rust-free -lrb- important here in humid florida -rrb- and strings last longer than they did before i started using this even though i 've always wiped the strings with a soft cloth after each use.i keep my slick string cleaner in a quart size ziploc-type bag because it 's not airtight when you snap it together and i do n't want it to dry out . 
i hope when it does dry out that i can just add some juice to rejuvenate it . 
i just do n't know what kind of liquid to use . 
i do n't want to drop $ 8 or so for a new one every time it dries out . 
any ideas are welcome , please add a comment to this review if you can help me out.bottom line , it extends the life of my strings and that 's always good . 
i honestly do n't see the purpose . 
it does n't seem to have improved my experience with my strings on my guitar . 
i 've used it a few times , but do n't see the benefit.edit 5/30/13 : after coming back to read the other reviews , it 's obvious what happened : this was shipped to me completely dry . 
there was no grease/lubricant qualities . 
it was like a dry erase pad . 
they need to improve their quality control . 
i 'm changing my rating from 3 star to 1 star . 
they have to find a way to fully secure this gap or maybe consider enhanced vacuum sealing packaging.i would suggest if you receive this product and it has n't dried out yet , to place this product in a air-tight ziplock bag to reduce the likelihood of this drying out . 
does everything you 'd expect it to do , as well as a couple of things you might not like.first , when run before the amp , it adds a bit of treble to the tone , and a hint of distortion.not to the point of being unusable , but you guys playing with the &#34; fender clean &#34; tone might notice . 
i certainly did.playing with overdrive or distortion makes this issue unnoticeable , as you would imagine.ive noticed that when using the pedal in an effects loop , the treble boost / distortion isnt there , or at least not noticeable . 
in my experience , of course , ymmv.those are minor complaints though , as the pedal works well , has more than adequate delay times -lrb- up to 600ms -rrb- and is built well.i strongly suggest using this with a 9v adapter , because this pedal will eat a 9v battery in a matter of minutes.overall its a great deal . 
no , its not as pristine a delay as a carbon copy or boss dd , but its a fraction of the cost of those pedals , and i doubt anyone but you will notice the difference . 
this is a very good quality , nice sounding delay . 
you can get that classic `` slapback '' sound or dial you in some nice lead delays for that classic rock sound . 
very simple to operate and that 's what makes these joyo pedals a `` joy '' to use . 
nothing fancy , but simple and to the point . 
another great selling point to me is that they are absolutely `` true bypass '' . 
i have bought the cheaper , `` plastic '' pedals and they make noise . 
they say that they are true bypass , but they are not . 
these babies are dead quiet ! 
i run mine through the effects loop on my bugera v22 tube amp and it sounds great ! 
i also own the joyo vintage od -lrb- tubescreamer clone -rrb- and it is great as well . 
highly recommend !!! 
this tuner works well for all my acoustic instruments that i ca n't plug into a tuner . 
banjo , guitar , mandolin , alternate tuning , even has a metronome for timing practice.great product , great price . 
i bought this after buying a red and blue clip on tuner . 
these are the best tuners for the money . 
the display is very stable and it 's simply fun and easy to use . 
if your looking for the best.quality smaller.practice amp this is the amp for u it 's definitely high quality its got .10 watts and overdrive and anything else u would need on a practice amp.definitely the best amp in this.price range i would.definitely.recommend it lots of juice , easy settings , very clean sound with all the horsepower you would need . 
i have n't jacked it up all the way ... i do n't think the cat would appreciate that . 
i get a little feedback every so often , occasionally it 's a little overly sensitive to my volume control on the guitar , but not enough to submarine this power packed amp . 
how do you get that much noise out of an 8 &#34; speaker ? 
beyond stoked ! 
bought so i could teach my son bass ... i cant believe how much sound comes out of this box . 
ampeg will always build my bass rigs , however big or small it might just be my pickups or my strings , but if you set the bass above seven or so , the bass gets fairly fizzy on the e string . 
the effects loop is useless , and it removes a lot of the character from the pedals , but that 's good news because with this amp you do n't need an effects loop because there is no built in overdrive . 
so if you ever do use a driven/distorted tone , you should just put a pedal in between your bass and this amp . 
i purchased this amp locally and initially , i thought it was pretty cool as it was my first modeling amp ; lots of potential for a limitless variety of sounds . 
this was my first fender amp as well.the presets were neat and all , but when i played around with some of the `` standard '' models -lrb- just the amp model , no effects -rrb- just to see how it 's clean sound was , the amp just hissed as if i had the volume cranked with a distortion pedal engaged at max . 
the master volume was at 2 and no effects were turned on ... i 've never heard a clean channel with so much noise behind it , even when there was no guitar plugged in ... all i could hear while playing was the underlying hiss coming through the notes ; very distracting and it drove me nuts ! 
this is n't a ground loop issue -lrb- my other amps sound just fine at bedroom volumes and beyond -rrb- , it 's clearly a defect with this product . 
dirty pre-sets with lots of gain and extra volume sound even worse , again , even when nothing is plugged in and at low master volume . 
you 'd think i was running a few super high gain stomp boxes with a red hot single coil , but nothing was plugged in and all i get is staticy-hiss at low levels . 
wtf?the next issue is the weird `` fizz '' sound , that was especially noticeable on the low e . 
after striking a string , instead of a clean note , there 's a weird fizzy digital artifact like sound that `` surrounds '' the note , and fades as the string stops moving . 
it almost sounds like cymbals crashing on a poorly authored mp3 file at a low bit rate and frequency . 
whole chords break down and decay in this fizzy envelope and really makes this thing unplayable.the weird thing is , neither one of these problems arose with head phones plugged in , or when this was connected to my computed via either usb or the line in ... but i 'm not going to be stuck playing a 100 watt amp through my pc or cans . 
i got the iii instead of the ii because of the power behind it and the touted 12 '' celestion speaker.read the many reviews online or forum posts on many of the guitar/amp related websites -lrb- there 's a 65 page forum post on the fender support site that is quite interesting -rrb- and you 'll find that these amps are having issues . 
apparently , the mustang i and ii do n't have these issues , and the firmware update did nothing to correct my amp . 
is this a hardware issue , software issue , speaker issue ? 
there is speculation that the lcd screen -lrb- which is not present on the i or ii -rrb- may be causing problems , but no one seems to know for sure and fender does n't seem to care ... definitely try this before you buy it . 
you may get an amp that does n't have these problems , you may not notice the sounds or you may not even care ; let your ears tell you what sounds good.this amp has a lot of potential for great sounds , and it would have been nice to have faithful modeling of some great vintage amps , but in my opinion , technical issues have made this amp sound like complete garbage . 
i am disappointed that fender has n't yet correct what ever is wrong -lrb- some folks claim that fender reps say that know what is wrong , but i 'm not taking that as a fact ... -rrb- , but they have acknowledged that there is `` something '' wrong.whatever ... i took this back after a few days of playing with it , trying to eliminate the junk sounds without success -lrb- the built-in noise gate helps a little , but sucks tone -rrb- and i picked up a 100 watt marshall instead . 
guess what ? 
the clean channel has zero hum or buzz , even when cranked . 
how about that ? 
even when i engage a dirt box on one of the dirty channels , there is minimal noise.i 'll knock fender for not correcting this issue regardless of what it is and what caused it , but they do have some other nice amps that i 'd like to try . 
but before i buy another fender amp , i 'll take it for a test drive and i suggest you do the same before picking up one of these turds . 
i do n't really care for the fx loop on my fender supersonic head , as i started to get more pedals in my system and really digging all the mxr pedals . 
so when this came out last year i snatched one up and started experimenting with it . 
i love it , bypassed i still get that in your face strait into an amp sound , but ingage it with my delays and phase 90 's and set the gate to about two o clock and it does a great job of clamping down on the tail end hiss . 
very cool , and of course it is an mxr so it is built like a tank item shipped earlier than i 've expected . 
when i opened the box was surprised as i did n't notice the usb cable . 
but later i thought that it was impossible and opened the box from another side and here it was ... i have plugged and installed usb driver and dedicated software in a few seconds . 
it is working fine . 
though it has no motorized faders , it does n't make my work uncomfortable at all . 
i have connected it to a reaper and protools software and it 's just working perfect!i recommend it to home studios , also those who travel with recording gear . 
nano is small but quite durable.i am happy with it ! 
great little controller for your daw , or whatever.easy to set up . 
dials and sliders work smoothly.i use it with reaper.the 8 sliders and associated dials and buttons are logicallyshiftable , so this little darling can handle any number of tracks , not just 8 . 
buy it !! 
if you love delay and want variety , this is your pedal . 
i run two amps when i play -lrb- often -rrb- and the ping pong is delightful for me . 
however , in the studio , this pedal shines as well providing a variety of incredible delay options . 
being toneprint enabled is a 100 % plus . 
very clean , quiet , and durable . 
excellence ! 
the product photos make this look like a small , plastic item with cheesy chrome plating . 
nope ! 
it 's a very solid , fairly large item made of heavy cast metal . 
you could drive nails with this thing -- no exaggeration.the folding legs are clever and provide good support for desktop use , but they have some drawbacks . 
yes , the meteor has standard mic stand threads in its base , so you can put it on a mike stand or boom . 
but if you want to mount this mic in a shock-absorbing rig -lrb- i 'm using a scissor-arm suspension boom with shock mount -rrb- , you 'll find the body is too short for the shock mount 's sleeve to grip , and the three legs get in the way . 
i had to make a special adapter from 1 5/8 &#34; plastic pipe and assorted hardware.the meteor 's sound is great as far as i 'm concerned , but i 'm not a professional audio engineer , so i 'm not going to try to tell you that this is the equal of a $ 1,200 sennheiser studio microphone . 
it is better than samson 's inexpensive gomic , which i also have . 
i certainly have no complaints . 
i 've used it to record voice and ukulele playing , and it 's done a bang-up job with both . 
just got this today and i 'm experiencing serious install issues . 
please note that i 'm not a newbie to this stuff . 
i 'm an it guy . 
i have a new acer computer that 's less than 3 months old with a new install of windows 7 . 
the mic is recognized , but not as a sound input device , just as an `` other usb device '' . 
i tried installing it on another laptop and it installed quickly and easily , so it 's not that the mic itself does n't work.my purpose in posting this is to let people considering this mic know that you ca n't just assume that the install is a no-brain ' r -lrb- at least not on a pc -rrb- . 
the samson tech support was friendly enough , but not very helpful . 
they had no idea what to do next or any suggestions for further support . 
the support guy said , `` well , that 's really all there is to it '' , which i can understand ... but i still have a $ 70 mic that wo n't work with my computer . 
i tried contacting microsoft tech support and they tried to help me too , but we could never get the mic to be seen as an input device . 
we tried it a number of ways and nothing worked.i ordered this for use with my ipad as well , and i ordered the `` camera kit '' to do so . 
despite what i 'd seen in the reviews and videos online , the mic i received would work not with that either . 
the mic needs to be powered by the ipad and it seemed mine was not getting enough power from the ipad because the little indicator light was still amber when plugged in -lrb- indicating it 's not getting enough power -rrb- instead of blue.i tried this on my wife 's ipad and my daughter 's too so it would not appear to be the ipad that is the problem -lrb- though it could be the camera connector , i suppose . -rrb- 
so ... i ended up returning the whole shooting match . 
disappointing too ... i really like the design of the mic and so many people say that it sounds so good . 
it 's a pretty great sampler to get a feel for the types of picks that you may like . 
i also prefer the feel of these over the plain plastic ones but thats just me . 
it 's fairly tough , but flexible . 
no noise that i can hear , and the connectors look solidly-mounted . 
i would definitely buy this brand again . 
it is ok as long as you do n't bump your guitar , else boom , it hits the floor . 
i do n't trust it and amazon has it way over priced . 
it will work if you put a nail in it to hold the holder in place . 
one thing tho . 
when your guitar is n't in it is prone to being hit and launching picks everywhere . 
i am going to be finding picks in my files for years . 
put it up on the table when your picks are not in it . 
the planet waves guitar rest works for ukuleles ! 
i just got one , and have used it for a few days , and it 's the bomb ! 
i can set my little ukuleles down now without fear of falling over . 
this product is a rubber disc with small `` arms '' in a gentle curve that nestles against the edge of any surface , and you can set your instrument against it , and voila , it does n't fall over ! 
here at home , i use it on the second shelf of a bookcase , and my concert sized ukulele fits like a glove , heel on carpet , neck in guitar rest.i 'm going to buy a couple more for my ukulele cases , because i can use them at one of my uke parties . 
if one sets a tiny ukulele on the floor , for instance , to take a whizz , they 're just small enough to go unseen and have someone step on them . 
here , i just find a spot near wherever i 'm sitting , and it becomes my `` lean '' spot , and i can even set my beer can on the round part on the back ! 
coaster uke/guitar holder . 
it 's quite immovable once it has some weight against it from the instrument . 
i could carry a metal stand with me , but it would n't fit in my ukulele case -- this planet waves product does . 
a winner . 
maybe they included some sticky pads and i missed it ? 
this thing is great in theory , but it gets knocked off my desk periodically when it does n't have a guitar resting in it.it does well at its job when it 's in use , i.e. it does n't fall when there 's a guitar , but i think i 'll use some tape or sticky gunk to help hold in place while it 's lying in wait . 
;-rrb- it is a little light if you bump it anything that you store in the top goes everywhere when the rest falls on the floor . 
as long as the guitar is on it works great . 
as the title , it works the way it 's supposed to . 
but i wish the rubber part that sits on the table is thicker and heavier so it wo n't move easily . 
nevertheless , it 's a low cost way to set your guitar against the desk without scratching the back of the neck and preventing the guitar from sliding down from the desk and falling on the ground . 
just remember , use some common sense , do n't expect the guitar to totally stable . 
this can work , but if you already use a guitar stand then it is a waste of money . 
it will work if you use your guitar next to the a table . 
there 's just no way i 'm going to give five stars to a piece of rubber . 
that 's what this is . 
it does n't even look quite as good as the picture , largely because the guitar picks laying on the top help a lot to dress it up . 
without those picks , it 's just black molded flab.the damnable thing is that this flab is actually quite useful . 
i bought this on a whim and cringed when i opened up the box . 
but for the last two weeks , it 's been propping my takemine up against a coffee table . 
the rubber is thick enough and non-skid enough that it keeps the guitar in place . 
effortlessly . 
it may not be much to look at , but it works really well.the top portion that rests on a table surface is about 1/4 inch think . 
there 's a nub in the front hat pushes up against the corner of he surface and fixes the rest in place . 
that 's about 5/8 inch thick . 
the cost of materials is probably not more than 50 cents , but it 's the design that sells this thing.if you can find this for less at a local shop , go for it . 
i paid amazon $ 6 . 
even at that , i consider it a good buy . 
i love this stomp box although i never stomp on it :--rrb- needless to say there are a wide variety of reverb available to you . 
my amplifier does n't have reverb so i route the effects send to it and leave it on . 
it has just become part of my guitar tone now and would n't think about playing without it ... most the reverb selection sound identical . 
they all sound good . 
i would say that the boss reverb pedal sounds better . 
i use this pedal in my pedal chain . 
it does n't get much action , my amp has a reverb . 
i was looking for trippy modern hifidelity effects on my guitar . 
i recently picked up the tc electronic mojomojo overdrive at a steal of a price , but i 'm evaluating based on its inherent quality relative to the retail price . 
i own many different overdrives , including light overdrives in the `` tubescreamer '' , and some ones capable of getting a bit more raucous -lrb- blues driver , ocd , joyo ultimate drive , etc. -rrb- . 
to me , this is closer to the tubescreamer family , as it does better as a clean boost or light overdrive . 
actually , the separate knobs for bass and treble and its darker tone remind me a bit of the digitech bad monkey.build quality - outstanding . 
it has an `` mxr '' style click button press , but the mechanism feels sturdy and built to last . 
the 9v jack is on the top , out of the way of the i/o jacks . 
the battery compartment opens with a unique oversized flat screw/button that you can easily get open with your fingers , or maybe a quick turn of a screwdriver . 
the thing is dense and build solid as a rock . 
i always appreciate the extra weight with pedals because lighter ones are less crush-resistant , and tend to get punted around by your cables . 
finally , the 4 knobs are built will with some force feedback , and several of them are actually notched to settle into the `` 12 '' position , which is a nice touch.tone quality - obviously , the tone quality is the most subjective part of this review . 
i would not be at all critical of a reviewer who gave this a `` 5 '' and absolutely loved it , as several previous reviewers did . 
but based on the pedals i have used and my experiences with the mojomojo , it feels more like a `` 4 '' to me . 
the tone is very warm , almost to the point of being muddy . 
whether the mod switch is a `` boost '' or a `` cut '' , the pedal is bassier in the `` up '' position . 
do n't get me wrong , i definitely appreciate the abundance of low-end frequencies , but it might get some tweaking to get that high end to shine through . 
i could also easily see it getting lost in the mix if you play with other instruments . 
it does a nice job of adding a bit of gain and saturation to your tone without coloring it too much with different character . 
however , if you 'd like a similar affect with a much more expressive -lrb- and brighter -rrb- output , try the mad professor sweet honey overdrive , or its `` clone '' companion , the joyo sweet baby overdrive.ease of use/versatility - many overdrives only have the single tone control , so i was excited to see controls for bass and treble . 
still , i feel like this is a pedal that could be great with some amps , and very muddy with others . 
i will update my review if my feelings change , as i have a few different combinations i want to try out . 
i feel that the preferred use of this pedal is as a stacked overdrive pushing some other type of overdrive or distortion . 
this is much the way you would use a tubescreamer . 
i will say that it is one of the more `` tube-like '' overdrives i have tried . 
hit the notes lightly , and you get a clean , transparent tone . 
attack them harder , and the higher output from the guitar will push the overdrive and cause further breakup , much like a tube amp . 
however , if your hope is simply to plug into the mojomojo into a clean amp and expect classic rock tones , you may be a bit disappointed with it as a standalone overdrive pedal . 
i got one of those for my next mandolin after my johnson . 
i could n't see spending 40 bucks for a case for a 50 dollar instrument , so i did n't . 
however , the next one cost a few hundred and i got one of these cases that has served me well . 
these are pretty soft inside and fit most a-styles pretty well . 
the hardware is decent but i would n't expect the hinges to last forever . 
they 'll be easy enough to fix/replace when they fall off , so no worries there.if i had a $ 2500.00 gibson/weber/whatever , i would n't buy this , i 'd spend the money for a really nice case , but since i do n't , i did n't . 
if you do have an expensive instrument and want to cheap out , these really are decent little cases but you wo n't mistake it for a really expensive one , and that 's fine.if it 's still built like my case -lrb- never can tell these days ... -rrb- it 'll have a little storage compartment that will hold a bunch of pics , capo and a little tuner with no problem . 
not big enough for a strap though with everything else in there . 
i order this for my glen burton cutaway . 
i had it in a gig bag , but acoustic guitars should n't be in a gig bag . 
i got tired of my guiitar being banged around in the back of the car so i ordered this hardshell case . 
it is wonderful . 
very well made and beautiful . 
it came to me right on time with no problems at all . 
it also has a lock on it so you can lock your guitar up so no one will get in to it . 
it is a little heavy , but that is something i can get use to . 
my guitar fit perfetly in it and is very snug . 
i love this case and it is worth every dime you pay for it , maybe even more . 
i bought this guitar case for wife , as she plays a acoustic guitar and needed to replace her &#34; gig bag -lrb- soft case -rrb- with a hard case that would protect her guitar better than the soft case could . 
she absolutely loves the case and it is well built and when you use it , it makes you think that this case should cost more , but for the $ 60 , it is an awesome deal.the case fits her acoustic like a glove and has a storage compartment for her mic cable , di box , picks and tuner . 
underneath the neck , there is enough space for storage of two sets of extra guitar strings . 
you might pay more for a name brand case ... save some money for soemthing else an dget this case , because it is a great deal . 
we found nothing negative that we could say about it . 
it also was packaged very well to protect the case during shipment and came very quick . 
i honestly do n't know how they can sell these cases for the price and give you free shipping too . 
i 've seen cheap quality chipboard cases and gig bags that cost more . 
this is a hard shell tolex covered case . 
they are sturdy , well padded with plush black lining , and look as good as cases costing much more . 
these cases are made for dreadnought guitars , and i bought two of them . 
one is for my ibanez ak75g arcrhtop electric guitar and it fits perfectly . 
the case has 4 brass latches and one is lockable and comes with 2 keys . 
it 's made in china , but is n't most everything these days ? 
i would n't recommend it for airline/railroad baggage , but this case will offer ample protection and safe storage for your instrument under most other conditions . 
i do n't think you 'll find a better deal on a hard shell guitar case anywhere else . 
do n't be fooled by the popular belief that more expensive is better . 
do yourself a favor and save a few bucks by buying one of these great cases ! 
i acquired this recently , i did not need another strat style , or copy of , but it 's white ... just got ta love that vibe ? 
anyhow lots of reviews justifiably good , here 's a few add ons in case ... it 's routed hsh under the hood but looks tight . . 
think it 's bucker size upgradable ; top and bottom did n't measure , i like single coils ... the white is a poly finish -lrb- love poly durable and crack/fade resist -rrb- and exquisite nicely done , alder body but it 's hefty alder , like 8lb or so . 
not so keen on headstock shape but the neck is nice , too nice to change like i was thinking till i got it ... nice quality control on these , really smooth rosewood board with med-jumbo -lrb- that 's what i call anyway -rrb- frets good fretting . 
standard hardware indicative of price but decent and well installed , no missed screw holes etc. . 
was set up with standard action etc , out of box was clean set up no buzz or uneven saddle stuff etc. great fit and finish , best i can tell its a standard f type plate , if interested looks to be easy changer.overall it 's a solid piece , assembled well , for me the body and neck is what seals the deal , better then most out there this range ... it is alder and hefty , but durable . 
i look to change most hardware in time so wo n't comment on that , what 's there ... is installed well ... 2 things i forgot tuners wan na say 15:1 ? 
10mm standard import style ... seem good , not legendary and tremelo/whammy standard zinc block -lrb- there 's the must upgrade part ... -rrb- it 's standard 10.5 string space import , i got one pet peave ; it 's steel or brass blocks ... a shame all these guitars nowadays with the zinc thin low sustain blocks , my advise get a fender mim standard lefty trem , the whole thing with steel saddles and all maybe 50 $ best money ever spent ... i ca n't afford the gotoh or callahan stuff , on this a standard mim import space fender with steel block and saddles is easy direct replacement and with the hefty alder you 'll get tons of sustain and tone and keep tuned way better . 
also the neck i say nice but i mean it 's nicer than most in the shape , it 's slightly chunky c shape ? 
not baseball bat chunky but you feel it on frets 1-3 it 's beefier ? 
i have avg . 
size hands , i find it 's a good fit.in all ... if your looking in this price range it 's nice , and upgradable as you can or learn more . 
i waited a few weeks to get used to the recorder before reviewing it , i didnt want to be like some of the other reviewers who gave a first impression review based of their lack of understanding.it works great for talks lectures and band pratice as well as muic ideas ... $ 12 16gb sandisc cards work great as long as you understand it only records up to 2gb at a time , but the tascam will jump to next 2gb if it runs over only causing a few second skip ... . 
it sounds good natural and spacias ... get it ... i paid $ 110 shipped for mine , so look on amazon or ebay for purchase ... the big music stores always mark up the prices very high ... zzounds , musicians friend sweetwater music 123 , dont buy from them ... jim cool pedal on a clean amp . 
i ran it into my dual gain amp and it just muddied the sound up . 
i am buying an old twin head that i want to try this on for a little vintage grit . 
i think it will work great for that . 
not every tune needs tremolo i grant you , but when you need one , this will do the job and them some . 
simple controls . 
the led pulses with the beat of the unit giving you a visual of the unit 's settings at all times . 
100 % silent switching . 
in a fx loop , there 's not a trace of hiss , hum , or noise in any form . 
in a chain running into an amp 's input , there is a slight volume increase . 
not much , but a little . 
no big deal really , unless you 're a real tone freak . 
there is no change in tone or any form of loss when in use . 
being a true bypass , it changes nothing when off either . 
the box is ultra solid . 
the jacks are all metal . 
the switch is stout . 
in short , this is a solid performing pedal that gives a nice clean , warm , tremolo that can not be beat at three times the cost of this unit . 
it it anchored to my board ! 
it is not going to come off because it 's that good . 
besides , how can you turn down a deal like this and get a pedal that has a crouching pitbull on it ??? this product is bad quality because the noise it makes . 
it increases the volume so much that it is better not to use it at all . 
i 'm going to sell this product . 
i did n't like it . 
not the greatest little pick up , for the price im more than happy with its performance . 
put it through a highr quality mixer and there are no problems , run it through a practice amp and it comes off a bit tinny . 
i wont fit in the sound hole to i clip it to the head stock and it works surprisingly well . 
cant beat it for the price . 
i put this in the soundhole of a concert ukulele and angled it toward the &#34; g &#34; string and it sounds great . 
what a buy for the price . 
you may have to experiment with position and for ukes some have found the headstock to be the best spot . 
whatever spot you find is best for you , it 's worth it , i 'm going to try it on my reso-uke next . 
only thing is you need to loosen some strings to get it into place , but worked great for what i wanted to screw around with it , first we have to realize this is not a $ 200 pickup or even a $ 50 pickup . 
it 's less than ten bucks.it has a specially-designed clamp that is good for attaching it to the sound hole of a guitar . 
as such it is not going to work for an instrument without a considerable-size sound hole . 
it also will tend to get in the way of those who play directly over the sound hole , as it is quite easy to hit and will pick up any contact noise.it is more sensitive than cheaper competitor devices . 
unless you run it directly into the amp within a distance of 8 ft you are also going to need a 1/4 '' to 1/4 '' coupler -lrb- to allow it to connect to an extension guitar cord -rrb- . 
you will need such extension as this tends to have significant feedback issues if the amp is too close or facing the guitar.it is a passive pickup , so you will need either an amp with a passive-specific input or a preamp mixer or other preamp device . 
if you do n't have a preamp system , this will do you no good.so because of the limitations i rate it as above . 
for what it does though -- providing a passive pickup that can be quickly switched out between instruments , it does okay . 
i believe there are better pickup concepts out there for about the same amount of money , including adhesive-disk mikes . 
i would prefer to permanently mount a pickup of some kind and there are many low-cost pickups out there to choose from . 
but this is a slightly different concept -lrb- removable -rrb- that for the price is worth checking in to . 
this may have been the best money i 've ever spent for a guitar accessory . 
i can dial the pressure to exactly what i need for any spot on the neck . 
it has a smooth action , no `` kerchunk '' noise . 
my guitar stays in tune when capo-ed . 
i love it ! 
well made , proven over decades . 
switched from ns capo to improve tone with a one piece mahogany neck . 
not sure there is a huge difference but there does seem to be an improvement . 
requires less adjustment . 
square pad allows placement right next to the fret . 
easy to adjust with a bit of practice.i enjoy using quality machined parts , so this is a pleasure , plus it is built to last . 
works amazingly well , is very precise , and easy to handle . 
i have seen other devices that would get confused about frequencies and jump back and forth between different notes . 
not so this one . 
it is a great , reliable tuner . 
does what it was intended to do . 
completely satisfied with this purchase . 
seems to work just fine for my needs . 
i bought this because i bought a used martin d15m that did n't have a tuner built in , and it clips right on the neck and is easy to turn on . 
the cool led readout instantly tells you which string , and gives you the `` green '' when the string is in tune . 
this is a great little tuner and i recommend it . 
i 'm pretty impressed with it . 
i 've only used plug-in types of tuners prior , and this was a nice surprise . 
i ran this through my ukulele , electric guitars as well as an electric bass . 
i was blown away how it could tune my bass . 
it works quickly , and it seems pretty accurate compared to my petersen . 
i would recommend it to anyone . 
took one star off for visibility . 
certain lighting and certain angles can wash out the display very easily . 
i used this to tune a coconut thumb piano . 
if it can tune that , it should handle your guitar or bass fine . 
was really impressed to see it in action . 
not the smoothest operation in the world but it 's gig-bag small and accurate . 
i had bought an sn2 and love it but i found it had a little trouble recognizing the low e on my bass . 
this handles bass tuning much better . 
the lit display is great for tuning on stage , and because it works on vibration you do n't need to worry about muting when you are tuning.i also find it very accurate . 
i would have given it 5 stars but the battery died after a couple of weeks . 
this is probably the seller and not the manufacturer . 
i 've had a few of these things , not all the same model . 
this one was hard to read . 
i changed the battery and that helped out quite a bit . 
overall i like it and use it on gigs instead of my pedal . 
this tuner is super easy to use and very user friendly . 
clamp it on , press the power switch , and then pluck a string . 
it will tell you if you are hitting the right note and if it is in tune.i only gave this 3 stars because the battery meter only indicated 1/2 charge out of the box . 
it still had the plastic barrier that had to be removed to connect the battery . 
should n't it have a full battery since it is brand new ? 
not enough of a hassle to send it back , but worth mentioning.had the battery not been an issue , i would have rated this 5 stars . 
awesome for $ 10 . 
accurate with tv on in the background . 
this thing is just sweet , i just love it . 
easy no-brainer . 
this is a very accurate tuner . 
i have used it on mandolins , guitars , violins and violas , and double bass . 
they are a little hard on batteries , but not overly so.highly recommend ! 
been using the snark tuners for while now ... functions perfectly . . 
only problem i have is it is small enough that i have trouble finding it sometime ... so , i have just started leaving it on the instrument and buying others to do the same ... the snark is great . 
i have 2 for my 4 ukuleles -lrb- so i can always find one -rrb- , and a 3rd for my guitar . 
it 's not just a uke tuner . 
love them ! 
and , gavemy grandson a shock-blue one to go with his american flag painted uke . 
works great and easy to use . 
it also seems to be very accurate . 
definitely worth the money !! 
-lrb- should also work for any stringed instrument -rrb- if you have a ukulele you know -lrb- or may not know -rrb- that it needs constant tuning especially with new strings . 
this little gadget does the trick . 
i was pleased to see that it is a no brainer to use and since it clips to the head it is there when you need it between songs.you will not go wrong with this purchase and i am sure you will love it better than trying the &#34; my dog has fleas &#34; tuning method.oh yea , it does not just limit you to the basic notes for the uke but will tell you sharp and flat notes too!now put that order in ! 
if you are like me , my research for a guitar connection to my ipad left me with choosing between the iriffport and the jam . 
i recently purchased , and then returned , the iriffport . 
i am very pleased that i purchased the apogee jam as a replacement . 
here are the reasons why :1 -rrb- the connector on the iriffport -lrb- the one that goes into the ipad -rrb- is not a strong connection at all ; it feels as though it could disconnect at any time . 
i have a stand to put my ipad on when jamming such that the ipad is in landscape mode , so the cord feels as though it will come out of moved the wrong way . 
with the apogee jam , the connector is just like the ipad 's connector , accept it also has the `` prongs '' that come out of it , securing the connector into the ipad . 
to remove the connector from the ipad , you need to squeeze the buttons on the connector to make the `` prongs '' go in so it can be removed ... very , very secure . 
i use the `` gumdrop '' case on my ipad , which has a flap that goes over the charging port when not being used . 
this flap feels pretty tawt when it is open while the charging port is being used . 
important : if you have such an ipad case , like me , i certainly feel that the jam will provide a much more secure connection to your ipad over the iriffport . 
in fact , the structure of the iriffport connector was so large , that i felt that it did not fit well through my case . 
on the other hand , the jam 's connector is the same small size as the ipad 's original connector . 
this is also something to consider if you intend to use your ipad in portrait mode on a stand with the connector on the bottom of the ipad .2 -rrb- probably the largest reason i prefer the jam over the iriffport : you can hear sound directly from the ipad . 
with the iriffport , you must use headphones or attach external speakers . 
i tried headphones with the iriffport and playing the guitar was very awkward . 
nonetheless , with the jam , i could attach headphones or external speakers to the ipad if i chose to do so . 
i wanted something that could make my ipad an amplifier for easy mobility around my house , without having to purchase another amplifier or external speakers . 
with the jam , i have this .3 -rrb- the jam has a gain meter -lrb- i.e. , an led -rrb- and a gain control . 
the iriffport does not . 
when not being used to measure the level of the incoming audio , the led lets you know if you are connected to the ipad , but not to any software -lrb- blue light -rrb- , or if you are connected to the ipad and to a software application -lrb- green light -rrb- . 
there are no batteries needed for the jam or the iriffport .4 -rrb- i personally like that i can use my own guitar cord with the jam . 
if the cord breaks , i simply replace the cord , not my ipad connection device . 
the iriffport uses its own cord , and the connection to my guitar did not feel as strong as my `` normal '' guitar cable i used with the jam .5 -rrb- although a fairly minor point , it is nice to know that the jam is advertised by apple -lrb- look at their website and their garageband video -rrb- . 
and , since i have garageband on my ipad , i was pleased to see that the advertising material on the jam states specifically that it works with garageband.so far , i 'm very pleased with the jam . 
ca n't believe they are still selling these things at full price with the old 30 pin connector . 
i have lots of pads but none still have the old style connector . 
this is now a boat anchor . 
to buy a 3 meter cable from them , they charge $ 40 for the cable , $ 15 to ship it and then tax . 
the extortion here is almost monster cable like . 
these folks should be embarassed . 
this is a great package for beginners . 
i never played a ukelele before but i learned to play guitar many years ago . 
i have no idea on how to tune a ukelele so i downloaded an app called `` easy ukelele '' available in amazon and google playstore for free . 
that is the only ukelele tuner i can recommend for beginners as it actually listens to your ukelele and tells you when your device is in tune . 
i purchase this as gift to my son 's 5th birthday that is coming up in 2 weeks so i have not yet preview the dvd and cd that came with it . 
i did however , checked and played with the ukelele while my son is at school , sleeping or playing outside to make sure that it is properly working when he open the box on his birthday and before the return period runs out.my review :1 . 
the package : the box comes with the ukelele , beginners manual , dvd , cd , carry pack , and 2 extra set of ukelele strings . 
tuner is not included so i advice that you either buy a tuner or download the `` easy ukelele '' app i mentioned above .2 . 
the ukelele : the ukelele looks and feels decent . 
it has a sticker that says made in china . 
it comes pre-strung but it is out of tune . 
i tuned it using the app i downloaded but it would not hold a tune . 
it is very bad that the sting gets out of tune before you even finish tuning all the other strings . 
basically , the ukelele sounded like an out of tuned toy when you first take it out of the box and even after a few adjustments . 
since the string is nylon , i gave it a chance to settle . 
i would tune it really sharp and leave it alone for at least 10 minutes or more then pick it up and strum on it and push the string from side to side . 
i actually position the tuner pegs horizontally so i can see if it is moving when the string gets more tension . 
the tuner pegs stays in place so i know that the problem is with the string . 
it could be that the string included is a cheap one . 
after doing this a few time on day 1 , i was able to play my first song i grabbed from the book -lrb- clementine -rrb- . 
but after 1 song , you have to tune it again . 
i just repeat what i did for the next 2 days , tuning it sharp and leaving it alone and play songs . 
yesterday morning i tuned it sharp before leaving to work and when i came back in the afternoon , i checked the strings and they are still tuned to the same key i left them in the morning . 
i played with it for at least 10 minutes just trying to learn the music from the book and i was able to play at least 4 songs without any problem . 
this morning , i checked the note again and they stay close to the g-c-e-a range . 
i could see this improving more as the ukelele gets used more . 
even if i have to tune it every day i would not have any problem with it.so , for the reviews complaining about the device being out of tuned , just give the string a try to settle . 
this are cheap string that they included here and it will take time to settle in . 
or you can buy a better quality string that costs around $ 9.00 for a set . 
another place you can check is the tuner , make sure that it does not get pulled back when the strings tension . 
if it would not hold its place then just grab a philips screw driver and tighten it a little . 
that is an easy fix .2 . 
the string : as i mentioned above , it is a cheap string that needs a lot of adjusting until it settles . 
even if you buy a good quality strings , i am sure that it will also need a few adjustment in the beginning . 
it comes with 2 extra set in case you accidentally snap the one that is already installed . 
the problem is that the extra set does not have a label so you have to eyeball it . 
from some research i found online they said that the thinnest string will be the a string . 
the second thinnest is the e string , the thickest is the c string and the second thickest is the g string . 
the extra string package says `` gangia brand '' on it so i assumed that that is the brand of the string .3 . 
the book : i just scanned the book and i could tell that it is written well for beginners . 
the songs included progress from only needing 2 chords in the beginning and they add more chords on the succeeding lessons . 
each song have a chart on which chord you will use .4 . 
the case : the case will protect your ukelele from dust , water and from getting dirty while you are transporting it but will definitely protect the device from being damage in case of a drop .5 . 
the dvd 's and cd 's : i have not tried the dvd and cd 's yet but the dvd 's i believe will have the lesson and the cd will have the songs on the books so you can listen to it and have an idea on how to play the songs on the book . 
i will come back and edit this item once i get the chance to watch the dvd and listen to the cd.overall . 
this is a great price for the package . 
well i found the lesson very good and worth the money i payed as far as the instrument it self found it to be sub par would of payed a few dollars more if the instrument was better quality but the lesson is great this pedal has a great range of function -lrb- with variable width and depth -rrb- along with an independent level control , and tone controls for low and high frequency cutoffs . 
it also has a dry through output.it can go from low depth high speed shimmers , to high depth , low speed oscillations , to ridiculous warble.the pedal is light weight , very high quality , durable , quite good looking , and all around a good pedal to play around with.cons : the blue led , like many blue leds , is very bright ; i usually cover them up with a sticker so i can see the setting on the pedal.it can also be easy to accidentally touch the pedal casing with the positive barrel of when plugging in -lrb- this can frighteningly spark -rrb- . 
so make sure to plug in the power adapted into the pedal before plugging in the wall . 
to start off with the unit is all metal construction and built like a tank , it is very easy to set up and use the controls are self-explanatory . 
you can get a wide variety of coarse effects from this unit from the very subtle to the crazy overdriven david gilmour sound.one distinct feature this pedal has that sets it apart from the rest is you can actually use base and trouble cut off controls to tailor the sound to make it sound less tinny and more full.overall for the money this is a fantastic value well-built and has outstanding sound get it you wo n't be disappointed ! 
i had used some boss ce-5 and ch-1 and substituted them with this unit . 
it 's has a cool analog/vintage sound of chours . 
i can put 5 electric guitars in gig bags on this stand . 
it is solid and no problems with itafter 6 months use . 
assembly was pretty easy and took little time . 
i bought the stand to better organize my personal studio space and i 'm satisfied enough to consider purchasing a second -lrb- too many instruments for my own good -rrb- . 
still , it could use some tweaks : i 'd recommend putting lock washers under all the nuts - very inexpensive and keeps the bolts tight - especially on carpet where there 's even more tendency for the pieces to shift about under stress . 
it also protects against over-tightening the bolts that can bend the relatively lightweight metal arms and support bars.i can imagine people feeling queasy about storing expensive instruments on a stand that feels like it would n't take much to tilt over forwards , but you should be able to convince yourself that the downward force of the instrument bodies -lrb- especially electrics -rrb- counteracts the weight of the necks leaning into the top support - making a forward fall unlikely.still , for sanity 's sake , i 'd position the stand close to a wall . 
at first , this causes a dilemma because your headstocks will extend beyond the front plane of the stand . 
but it 's easy to rig up one or two 6-8 inch support pieces from wood or pipe insulation-covered metal to brace the stand against the wall while providing comfortable clearance for the headstocks . 
removing any worry of a fall is worth the effort.the design can hold a variety of instrument body shapes ; the trick is to find the optimum balance point but it 's not hard : i fit an acoustic bass guitar , a 335-shaped ibanez artist , strat , sg-shaped bass , j-bass , a martin om-1 , a long neck bouzouki , six-string banjo and a nick lucas-shaped recording king acoustic on it . 
that said , i do n't max out the seven slots - i 'll use at most 5 , simply because different shapes make catching a strap and banging an instrument too easy when they 're that close . 
if i were storing all electric guitars or basses with similar shapes , i might be comfortable with six or even seven.i would n't use this stand on stage - and by ` on stage ' i mean any setting with people moving about who might come into contact with it , including a house party , basement jam session , etc. . 
it 's simply not sturdy enough , physics or no . 
but for my needs it works well and saves me a lot of floor space where it 's tight to begin with . 
it works as advertised but be aware it 's not for anything freshly painted or any guitar with a nitro finish . 
it will mess up the finish . 
nitro is usually used on your more expensive guitars like my gibson les paul for example . 
it 's amazing how many guitar stands can mess up your finish , that 's a pretty major design flaw . 
but they just keep making them.anyway , it is a nice little stand but be careful . 
if you have a nice guitar you 'll want to cover the padding with some cloth to avoid possible damage . 
works well first of all , this is a $ 40 7-guitar stand . 
it 's not a high-end $ 200 pro stand . 
that being said , the materials are decent . 
it seems strong and stable . 
i would not recommend it if you plan on using it to move from gig to gig . 
i bought it to have a convenient place to keep our 5 guitars and basses handy . 
rather than having 5 individual stands , this stand is perfect for keeping our living room neat.the metal is decent , but if you tighten the screws too much , the metal does flex/warp . 
so far so good . 
this stand is ok for light home use . 
i would not recommend this thing for gigging or travel . 
very cheaply made but does the job . 
guitars do not rest naturally in a sweet spot . 
you must set a guitar down in the correct position or it will lay a bit sideways and jar other guitars on the rack . 
avoid if you can spend more . 
do n't fret position indicator for 4/4 violin or 14 &#34; viola is very helpful tool , especially for beginners . 
if you start to learn violin - buy it , it will make your study much prettier . 
i had thin cut strips of duct tape on my fretboard before and then i saw this , not only is it alot more visually appealing but its more accurate aswell this is a great guitar for the money !!!! it has low action and has a truss rod in the neck for adjustments ! 
the built in tuner works great and plugged up this guitar has a very natural and clean sound . 
i would recommend this guitar to anyone looking at it !!!!! my c5ce washburn has been a very good purchase . 
i was looking for a guitar with enough space between strings so that my fingers would not mute strings accidentally while practicing cords . 
i prefer guitars having solid woods , not laminated like this one . 
it has the ability to plug into an amp , has easy access to the battery , has a built in easy to use tuner , and the wiring dose not rattle about . 
it has a good compensated saddle , the frets are level and do not buzz , has a truss rod in the neck , and has a bound rosewood fingerboard . 
i have always liked the sound of classic guitars , like the option to plug in , and am more impressed by sound than brand name.a person who has small fingers might be better off looking for a narrower neck . 
this is not a small guitar or a thin body guitar . 
it rings out very well , so it is not a quiet guitar but is not likely to disturb your neighbors unless plugged in.mine has some edges not well stained , likely due to glue squeeze out during assembly . 
top is a bit wavy , from buffing . 
still has some orange peel but not a lot . 
lastly , the nut and saddle are too high for my preference . 
some people may be turned off by the orange color of the top , sort of a classic color that i have gotten used to now.other guitars in this price range are typically made with laminated tops or backs , this model is not . 
i was not clear enough above where i mentioned laminated woods.if something happened to it , i would be likely to replace it with another one just like it . 
a very cost effective , good sounding , well made guitar . 
good job washburn . 
i bought these because they were an &#34; add-on &#34; offer and i 'm glad i did . 
i do n't play uke but a friend turned me on to using them for bass . 
these are a little too soft for guitar -lrb- check out the dunlops -rrb- but i 'm going to make sure i have some of these around , too . 
recently got the itch to try some different picks out just for fun . . 
these , rubber picks , metal picks , etc. . 
i play guitar.i 'm not crazy about these for that purpose , but they are n't made for guitar obviously , so i ca n't fault them . 
they seem to be made well made . 
they are larger than i expected , and rather thick.obviously these are made for ukes , so my review is probably not helpful to many . 
if you 're like me and were looking for some variety for the guitar i 'd suggest the rubber picks instead . 
they give a similar mellow sound without mudding up the tone , and they are easier and more comfortable to use also . 
heck , maybe uke players should try those too ? 
aloha friends ! 
simply put , if you have a ukulele , then these are the picks that you should be using . 
cheers ! 
my pet use to roam the car while driving . 
he has learned to stay stationed and relaxes a lot more ! 
i 've used this mic with my tascam us-800 audio interface , and pc , to record a high school chorus concert , and have gotten very good audio reproduction from this microphone . 
i placed one of these microphones as a soloist microphone , and one as a piano/instrument microphone , and have gotten great results from both . 
the reproduction of the sound was very good . 
the mic seems very solid in build , and able to possibly take a little abuse , which is good with a travelling recording system , but i definately would n't try dropping one , even though they 're a nice metal case , and metal grill . 
i 'd recommend these mics to anyone looking to get a good reproduction of sound for both vocals , and instrumentals , on a budget . 
i have yet to try these with micing guitar amps , but that 's my next step , as well as drums . 
this mic is good considering the price . 
does it sound exactly like a 57 ? 
no . 
do it have a decent quality sound ? 
absolutely . 
if you 're expecting an sm57 , then buy an sm57 . 
if you want something close , on . 
a budget , this is your mic . 
great value and good sound . 
they do the job great not a bad price for as many as you getgoing to buy some more for sure i could n't say that i loved it . 
it 's only a guitar hanger . 
it just holds a guitar . 
if i needed another i would buy this type . 
i am worried that i will damage my instruments if they are left standing around . 
this will allow me to show off and protect them . 
it 's easy to install , very tough , and i love how it looks . 
it can support quite a bit of weight -lrb- assuming you properly installed it on a stud , and not in drywall -rrb- and helps with cable management on a rough day . 
installs with two screws . 
i do n't trust the sheet rock anchors that come with the screws . 
i drilled into wooden studs . 
it is firm , secure and would probably hold a 200 pound gorilla . 
these seem very well made . 
the prongs are adjustable to hold almost any stringed or bowed instrument . 
some of the foam padding used in hangers and stands may cause a reaction with nitro cellulose finishes , so i will keep my eye on it for a while . 
over all , it is a good way to display your instruments , it allows easy access and unclutters the floor in my very small music room . 
i bought 4 and going back for more . 
i 've got three of these to hold an acoustic , a mini strat , and a jazzmaster ... . 
while i had no doubts about their capacity to hold the former i was somewhat leary about the later -lrb- it 's quite a bit heavier than the other two -rrb- but after putting some weight on it and it not coming apart i have been trusting it ... do not fix these directly into drywall with the screws provided though they seem awfully small for the weight of a full-size electric -lrb- and i have my doubts about those plugs -rrb- , the hanger will hold but the drywall might not , get some good wall anchors at your local hardware store rated for at least the weight of your instrument . 
i used a different setup , # 10 philips -lrb- slotted round heads would have actually been better -rrb- to fix them to a nice piece of 3/4 x 6 x 6 pine and screwed that into the studs with some 2.5 '' # 12 screws . 
needless to say it 's not going anywhere . 
as a bonus of this scheme even the acoustic hangs free of the wall.ok , one month later and nothing has come down so clearly they work fine even for something as heavy as a jazzmaster . 
good thing i did n't trust the plastic anchors . 
i put a bit of weight on it & the screws came out of the anchors . 
the anchors stayed in the wall . 
i found a stud & it works & looks fine . 
good inexpensive guitar hangers . 
i 'm getting a few more !! 
yes , i bought 3 and they fit all my guitars , mandolins , ukulele , bass.very easy to install on the wall . 
given to sister from mysel . 
she noted it very compact and discreet in hanging instrument out of way of any impending fracture . 
it was almost obvious this product would come from china but even worse when it ships from china . 
any thing i have bought that was shipped directly from china has been much lower quality than anything retailers are even willing to sell . 
if you can wait a month for delivery or longer , if you dont mind your guitar falling off the wall when the chinese quality lives up to its reputation then order up . 
if you have over a $ 500 guitar be wise and buy an expensive one unfortunately they will most likely be made in china too . 
i have decided to build my own i lost a recording/rehearsal space i shared with some musician friends when it burned down from an electrical fire during ` superstorm ' sandy late last year . 
a total loss - and we had no insurance -lrb- we sure learned our lesson -rrb- . 
so , we rented a new space -lrb- this time it 's nowhere near the shore -rrb- and we are re-building . 
we 're starting from scratch , and little odds and ends like guitar hangers add up after a while -lrb- it 's bad enough we had a number of instruments , amps , and other equipment to replace -rrb- . 
so if we can save a few bucks here and there , it helps.i bought one of these hangers to see if they were any good . 
after i tried it and it worked fine , i went back and bought another 9 of them . 
we have guitars , basses , ukeleles and mandolins hanging from them - they work on all sizes . 
we use those wide-threaded sheetrock anchors to screw them into the wall . 
like i said , they 're nothing fancy , but they get the job done ! 
the hanger was very easy to install , holds my acoustics safely , the instruments are easy to take down and put back in the hanger.the product arrived within 2-3 days , i could n't believe how fast it got here.and yet the price is the best part of all . 
the wall mount is very good , adjustable so it fits my guitars perfectly . 
the screws & anchors are poor . 
if you are not putting this into a stud , go get you some better anchors . 
do not trust these to hold your guitar if mounted to drywall only . 
while i would n't trust these to hold up my electric guitars , i have found other uses for them and have 2 of them now . 
the 1st one i used to try and hold my dean from hell guitar but it just mashed that foam around the yokes into nothing and did n't want it to damage my baby . 
so i ended up using it to hang my rock band guitar . 
this 2nd one i 'm using to hang up my beats pros.i chose this product over some simple hook to hang my headphones is because of the foam covered yokes . 
i figured if you spread the weight over 2 cushioned points instead of a single unprotected point of a hook that the head cushion would hold up better . 
and the distance of the yokes means that the ear cushions wo n't ever touch the wall.this is a fantastic product if you understand it 's limitations . 
i would recommend this for acoustic instruments , any type of rb/gh guitars , and probably your lighter/cheaper/mostly plastic electric guitars ... or even headphones that you 'd like to baby . 
great hook ! 
supports a lot of weight . 
looks good on any wall.i would highly recommend this hook to anyone for any application . 
wanted to hang my guitars on the wall . 
these hooks are padded , and rotate a little . 
provides a strong , non damaging support for some fine guitars . 
the difficulty in installing was i wanted them to be screwed into a solid wall stud . 
i had to attach them to a wood board , that i attached to the wall . 
this also provided a additiional 3/4 &#34; separation from the wall . 
the guitars are less likely to bang on the wall . 
this is a cheaper alternative to the &#34; string swing &#34; wall mount -- considerably less expensive . 
it works fine . 
it 's easy to mount , easy to adjust and holds the instrument well . 
the only downside is that the wall anchors are n't the heavy-duty plastic screw-in types but the smaller drill-a-hole-and-hammer-in-place types , which are neither as convenient nor as solid a mount as the others . 
of course you can always purchase a couple of screw-in heavy-duty mounts and you 'll still save considerably.this of course does n't have the beautiful hardwood finish of the string swing . 
for the lower price you get black plastic . 
but it 's sturdy enough , it looks fine and it does the job . 
if it had sturdier wall mounts i 'd give it 5 stars . 
as it is , the cheaper and less-trustworthy mounts bring it 4 stars and a nod for being an inexpensive alternative . 
it is great for hanging ukuleles and mandolins and with sturdier screw-in mounts , should hold any size guitar . 
i bought this holder and then mounted it on a stand i built of cherry and maple for my uke . 
it does the job . 
it could be just a little stiffer in its adjustment , but it stays where i put it , so no complaints . 
keeps gear dry.not for airplane travel or shipping , but perfect for spare guitars.zipper works fine ; fabric as good as gig bags three times as much . 
the behringer 302usb premium 5-input mixer is just what the doctor ordered . 
nice unit and works perfectly for vocals/guitar / bass guitar and keyboards . 
do n't lock yourself down with a bad usb / 1/4 : cable each bx5 d2 speaker has its own amp onboard and power supply . 
want a 5 channel system - buy 5 speakers and run xlr audio to each one . 
no noise or hum . 
has both trs and xlr inputs - has a knob for gain control on back . 
most importantly each speaker has an iec connector for power to just that speaker . 
mine sit left and right of my mixing panel using trs outputs which copy the xlrs - those go to my marantz pmd 580 digital recorder w / 32 gb of datacard memory onboard and a nice set of vu meters . 
speakers include a foam stick on bottom to prevent buzzing against hard surfaces . 
there is , however , no mounting point - no captive nuts or such.you 'll need to adopt a philosophy on gain . 
you can crank the speaker gain to 100 % and use your mixer to set the levels but ensure that your recorder gets enough signal to be in the -15 to -6 db0 range . 
it may be a tad loud - in that case you may want to set both speakers to their 12 oclock position which is 50 % power approximately.you could alternately use the mixer to run near 0 db and turn it way down on the speakers . 
i like to use mine to listen to talk shows before falling asleep at night so i turn the volume way down but drive them with -6 db0 off the mixer.having a separate power supply and amp for each speaker makes for some great isolation.my ** first ** nitpick is there is no grill cover on these like other maudio products have . 
i will have to fabricate some protection . 
my second nitpick is i owned the smaller m-audio 4 '' monitors where the amps were in the left speaker and the right speaker connected with twin lead speaker wire to the left i.e. not true bi amping but smaller spkrs for my mixer . 
the speaker w / 2amps died at 15 mos after buying it . 
it was not the power supply as being on made the box warm , but the led surround around the vol knob would not light and you could barely hear the audio even with -3 db0 into the trs line in . 
thats a different cheaper model by maudio but i had to trash it and buy these which are much nicer!i do like this set of speakers . 
from stereo to 5.1 surround they do the job with differential audio inputs . 
i may get 3 more for 5 ch as i have a sub already . 
arrived fast , had them up and running in minutes . 
it was easy to adjust my eq on my laptop to produce awesome listening music , just beautiful , clear , nicely separated sound . 
i would n't use these for high volume stuff , the sound is almost delicate , and very precise in its separation . 
the classical musician 's in our guild loved the sound , that should tell you something . 
stunning , really . 
they are , in fact , exactly what they are advertised to be - top notch small room project studio monitors . 
i readjusted my eq for the needed flat response for sound engineering and i was extremely pleased with the results . 
the sound you can get out of these is so varied that we needed to give our hearing time to adjust , as the flat studio mixing eq sounded horrible at first , as it should ! 
i have been in and out of studios for 30 years and i can say , used appropriately , these are excellent near-field mixing monitors . 
take time to review the set up data from m-audio , its good stuff , and do n't ask these little beauties to be everything , just let them be what they were made to be ... and enjoy ! 
we ended up re-mixing half a dozen acoustical songs off a recent project with these via cubase 7 and the general consensus is that the mixes improved by 30 % . 
as the reviews herein have indicated , there is a wide variety of uses for studio monitor like the m-audio bx5 . 
with the proper cables , you can hook up everything from an ipad , to a home computer , to a musical instrument or stereo . 
i will preface this review by saying that i am no &#34; audiophile &#34; . 
i have a basic understanding of speaker and musical equipment , but my primary goal here was to find a small speaker that i could use to monitor guitar playing through either a preamp pedal or ipad modeling software.with those goals in mind , i was pleasantly surprised how good the bx5 sounded . 
the goal of any &#34; studio monitor &#34; is to convey as much of the true sound of the source material as possible without coloring the tone with additional equalization . 
there are some monitors in a comparable price range like the rokkit 5 and options from mackie and jbl - i have not tried those out . 
but the bx5 performs we well or better than i hoped.for guitar playing , i use it in close proximity on a desktop . 
i found that it had a surprising amount of low end punch for a 5 &#34; woofer , given that my fender tube amp has a speaker twice the size ! 
the bass is tight and articulate , which is what you want . 
again , if your goal is just to drown out the sound with additional base , go get a pair of beats headphones or hook up a dozen subwoofers to it . 
that was n't really my goal . 
but all that aside , having enough low end was important to me , and the bx5 delivers . 
using modeling of &#34; fender &#34; and &#34; vox &#34; type amplifiers , it also handled the high end &#34; chime &#34; well without sounding &#34; tinny &#34; . 
i should note that i got an xlr -lrb- microphone -rrb- cable that converts to trs on the other side . 
i had heard/read that this was the best way to get a guitar signal into the thing , though there are likely adapters and other cables you could use to accomplish the same thing . 
there are both xlr and trs inputs on the back . 
the monitor is powered , so there 's a power cable , as well . 
there is a volume knob , but no independent bass/treble adjustment , as on other monitors . 
so if you want that , look elsewhere , but if the monitor is actually relaying most of source tone , you should n't be using it anyway . 
really enjoying my bx5 so far , wish i had the budget/space for a 2nd one ! 
this is a wonderful item that really works ! 
arrived fast ! 
having a great time making picks out of old credit and gift cards ! 
this makes a great gift item ! 
this is shown on an electric guitar and it would probably be great there . 
i play acoustic guitars and the headstocks all angle back it has to attach at the top then it is hard to see the screen . 
it worked but i do n't use it anymore . 
item is really convienient . 
small , unobtrusive size w / good illumination for easy reading . 
i like the swivel design & swivel display that allow you to connect it to whatever side of the headstock you want . 
price ca n't be beat either . 
works very well and is almost hidden on the guitar , it is one of those things that once you have it the other ones that stick out seem poorly designed . 
this one will stay on my guitar the others i always took off once it tune as they look so awkward this is a decent to good little tuner , but there are some drawbacks to it . 
also , i have the otherplanet waves chromatic headstock tunerto compare this one to . 
here are the pros and cons of this tuner as i see them : pros : - super compact . 
virtually invisible from the front of the guitar . 
- adjustable frequency settings . 
- top load battery . 
no need to unclip from the headstock to load in a fresh battery.cons : - awkward in use when not used on a inline six tuning peg headstock . 
i have a gibson les paul and this tuner is awkward to use with it . 
- less gradation in setting than other tuners . 
the gradiation bars are thicker and fewer in number , giving less of a sense of how close you are to a perfect tuning.debatable : - clip mechanism : not spring loaded . 
this means that this unit is really designed to stay clipped to your guitar . 
- one battery : this unit takes only one battery versus two with the other.when it boils down to it , i prefer my old planet waves tuner . 
it seems more accurate to me with the finer gradations -lrb- though both units gave roughly the same results when tuning - using both at the same time -rrb- and i like the ability to clip it on and off in a hurry . 
in fact i can easily recommend that tuner , main drawback is that that one eats batteries -rrb- this tuner is more catered to fender-style headstocks for players that plan on leaving the tuner clipped on . 
for those players , bump up this review to 4 or 4 and half stars . 
for others , i highly recommend the other planets waves tuner linked to in this review . 
i have both this tuner and a snark for each of my instruments . 
though i am not a professional musician , i find each them to be of equal accuracy . 
in fact , the d'addario 's compact size and fit is totally un-noticeable and though its screen is micro in size , it is very clear and viewable denoting flat/sharp notation . 
a great choice for the price .

tested on 4 ukuleles and one guitarso , ukulele players : yes , this tuner is for you.i tested this diminutive tuner on : - sopranino -lrb- ohana -rrb- - soprano -lrb- pono -rrb- - concert -lrb- kala -rrb- - 8-string tenor -lrb- pono -rrb- it 's tiny so you can clip it to your favorite uke and leave it there . 
it 's a bit problematic on the sopranino , as the tuner geta in the way if you try to clip it to the side , so it need to clip to the top.tuning is easy . 
just pluck the string and the note letter appears on the screen . 
if it 's red , you 're off ; if it 's green , you 're in tune.when you 're off , little bars will display by the note letter : left if you 're low , right if you 're high . 
tune in the direction needed until there 's one bar on each side of the note and the note 's name turns green . 
quick and easy.i 've compared this little guy to three other chromatic tuners and it 's dead accurate.as others have noted , the only concern is around the little plastic latch that holds the tuner to the headstock . 
but , it 's held together fine so far and i 've had it for weeks . 
i wanted to use this thing for a while , before i reviewed it -lrb- i now own five of them -rrb- . 
when i compare it head to head -lrb- so to speak -rrb- with other tuners , even the ones built into my ovation guitars , i find that this one has a little higher resolution . 
that is , when the others say i 'm good , this one says `` no , you need to go one tick more '' . 
that 's not saying that it 's inaccurate , it 's saying that this one seems to dial you in just a little bit tighter than the others , but it still does it very quickly . 
since i never take it off of the guitar , i went ahead and trimmed off the little tabs on the front of the clamping mechanism , making it even more unobtrusive . 
you can barely tell it 's there from the front . 
i want to like this more but it 's not as good as my other tuners . 
tuning calibration on the meter seems skittering to me making it a little difficult and not . 
as easy as the little round ones from snark . 
i like those better and they 're cheaper . 
i normally use my korg foot-switch tuner for my guitar and basses ... this guy really had me believing in small-vibration-tuning . 
three key words for this : accurate + small + inbeat ! 
this tuner is tiny and works as advertised to tune my guitar , bass and banjo . 
i have tested it against other , older and larger tuners and all tune to the same accuracy , which is very good.i docked it one star because the screen does n't stay on -lrb- in my opinion -rrb- long enough when i am trying to tune a string . 
when i pick a string , the screen flashed for a brief second with the tuning information and then goes blank . 
it works , but i find other tuners easier to use that have screens that stay on longer with each pick.perhaps a more experienced guitar play may only need that brief flash of tuning information to tune a screen , but for me i find it easier to have the tuning information displayed longer.also this tuner is tiny . 
i can leave it on my instrument when i put the instrument in a case , no problem at all . 
the flip side of this is that the screen is tiny too . 
really tiny ... almost hard to read tiny . 
you need to decide if this tiny size is an advantage or disadvantage for you . 
i tried this after i lost my planet waves ns design mini tuner . 
not sure if i lost it at a gig , or my three-year-old son got his hands on it , i 'd bet the latter.this micro tuner is smaller and lessobtrusive than the mini , which is nice . 
that 's about the only pro . 
there are a few other features i guess , like being able to select the instrument used , but i do n't need that.cons : the readout is smaller , duh , but does not seem to be as bright . 
i play a lot of outdoor weddings , in bright sun , and this one is much harder to read than the mini.this micro tuner does not seem to tune as responsively as the mini . 
as you move closer to in tune , the bars do not smoothly move towards the center , so it 's easy to over or under tune , and can take a few more seconds then the mini to get the job done . 
and those seconds can count when a bride is waiting for you to play her song to walk down the isle and you 're trying to get your tuning absolutely perfect . 
i 'm also trying to tune my semi-acoustic guitar as quietly as possible , so using my ear for fine tuning is not a viable option.does it get the job done ? 
yes . 
but there is a product that 's almost the same size that works a little better , for a negligible price difference . 
it might even be cheaper . 
if you 're a beginner and want to select the instrument you 're tuning and a few extra seconds is n't an issue , or you play in dark environments and do n't need a super bright readout , this will be fine , but i will be going with the mini when i buy a new one . 
i 'll be upfront and honest right away and say that i 'm not the biggest fan of headstock tuners . 
i love the idea , but usually i feel the execution leaves a bit to be desired . 
but when this popped up on my vine newsletter i thought i 'd give it a go and see if this one fixed any of the things i do n't like about the other ones -lrb- * cough * snark * cough * -rrb- . 
a little background first , i guess . 
i 've been playing guitar for the last 9 years , and i currently have two other tuners . 
i have a little korg plug in type , where you can have it pick up your signal with an instrument cable or just use the microphone on the front to tune up . 
i also have a boss tu-3 pedal tuner . 
if i 'm jamming with friends or playing a show , the tu-3 is what i 'll use to stay in tune . 
its very durable and accurate , and i like how i can step on it to engage both the tuner and cut out my guitar signal , so i can tune in silence and not annoy my friends and/or the audience . 
for home practice i use the korg , as i usually tune up before i start playing , then just plug into my practice amp and blast away . 
the korg is nice and accurate , easy enough to use for alternate tunings , and in 9 years of having it around -lrb- including in and out of jam sessions before buying the tu-3 -rrb- i 've only had to buy one replacement.i first saw a headstock tuner a year ago when a friend went to get an electronic tuner and the guy at the guitar store talked him into that blue snark that everyone seems to have these days . 
he was not incredibly pleased with it . 
not only was it somewhat garish to have a big blue ball sitting on your headstock , it seemed kinda flimsy to me and it was n't exatly easy to tune up with it . 
while i thought the idea of having a tuner that worked off the resonation of your guitar would be cool , it seemed like the design had a bit of a ways to go before it was something i 'd want on my headstock.enter this mini headstock tuner by planet waves . 
does it fix the problems that made the snark so unappealing to my friend and me ? 
1 . 
accuracy : it does seem to tune accurately , that 's a good thing , and it already puts this ahead of the snark . 
its not easy to use for alternate tunings however , so do keep that in mind . 
also , the letters take some getting used to , as they use that kind of chunky lcd block style that you find on some dvd players . 
not a huge complaint , but it is n't as idiot proof as my korg or tu-3 .2 . 
looks/ease of use : it 's quite a bit more subtle than the snark , able to hide behind your headstock , which is quite preferable to having a blue ball sitting on the end of your guitar . 
the only problem with it hiding behind the back of your headstock is if you have a les paul style headstock where you have three tuners on each side , you may have trouble finding a spot where the tuner actually fits and can be seen . 
my lp copy has the larger grover tuners so my only choice is on the very end of the headstock . 
i wear my guitar fairly low , so i was able find an area where i can see it from the top down , but those who sling it a bit higher might be outta luck . 
those with fender style headstocks should have no problem , though , it 'll work great for them . 
also , it is plenty bright , so seeing it well enough is not going to be an issue .3 . 
durability : this is where the main drawback to these types of tuners are . 
the snark is very easy to break , as it rests on a small ball joint . 
this planet waves mini is n't going to lose its head too easy , but the ratcheting clip is made of plastic and i do n't expect it to hold up under too much use . 
the tuner itself is made of fairly light duty plastic too , so as nice as it would be to keep this in your pocket on the way to a jam session , i still think it would be easy enough to break . 
i have n't had it long enough for this to happen yet , so i can only give you my initial impressions . 
let 's just say this , i 'd never gig with this guy as my only tuner . 
its obviously not going to be rugged enough for that type of use.all in all , it is a better headstock choice than the snark . 
however , headstock tuners as a whole still have a ways to go before they 're gon na work for everyone . 
anyone who gigs often would be better off getting some kind of pedal tuner -lrb- i personally suggest a boss tu-2 or tu-3 or a korg pitchblack -rrb- . 
i know they 're more expensive , but you 'll be happier off in the long run . 
those looking for a convenient way to tune up between songs during a jam session , this is a nice option . 
but it may not hold up forever.i 'll probably stick to my tu-3 and my korg plug in , but as headstock tuners go , this is nicer than most . 
i ordered this because i have an ovation , and none of the clip on tuners were able to get a good grip on that kind of headstock.due to the small size and adjustable clip , this tuner fit perfectly , and well out of the way . 
it took me a few tries to get used to pushing up on the on/off button , but no problem now.as a tuner , i really like it . 
the small green screen is easy to read in low or regular light -lrb- have n't tried it in bright light yet -rrb- , the bars for fine tuning are pretty stable , and it did a great job in a noisy gig , where i changed tunings about 10 times during the evening . 
i just put theplanet waves pw-ct-12 ns mini headstock tuneron my stratocaster last night . 
it replaces several other tuners i have been using that hung off the headstock and tended to come loose and fall off or had to be constantly re-secured and positioned -lrb- and removed/re-attached when i transferred my guitar to/from the case -rrb- . 
the mini takes care of all those problems -- i attached it between the low e and a string tuners , inner facing with the display rotated to face me . 
it is sensitive and accurate . 
the display is quite readable , even without glasses and features a color change to green when near or in tune . 
there are fine tuning bars on either side of the note indicator so you know when you are right on . 
i can leave it attached when i case my guitar which is a huge plus . 
the battery is top loading so i do n't even have to remove it to change the battery , which probably wo n't be for a while since it has an effective auto-shutoff function -lrb- as opposed to other tuners i 've used that are supposed to shut-off when no audio energy present but do n't and kill the battery -rrb- . 
also the display is smaller and as such , probably requires less power to operate which translates to longer battery life . 
it can be turned on -lrb- or manually turned off -rrb- with a simple touch of an easily palpated power button . 
the frequency is adjustable + / - 10 hz from 440 if you need that for some reason . 
it uses a clip to attach via friction , which is adjustable and the clip is padded so it wo n't scratch the finish of the headstock . 
i am so happy with this tuner i am buying two more immediately , one for my breedlove acoustic , another to keep as a spare . 
every once in a while i happen across products designed to fill a specific niche that fill their designated need perfectly and this is one of them . 
i was looking for a strap locking designed button for my acoustic guitar . 
these work great and look sweet too . 
their shape keeps your guitar securely in place , but is also easy to unhook when your ready . 
high quality product and very easy to install . 
just what i wanted . 
brilliant solution to the strap button problem ! 
the pointy end makes it quick and easy to get your strap over the button while the larger sized top will then hold the strap on so it wo n't slip off ! 
works as well as locking strap buttons did , for me . 
i like these little guys . 
i 'm not a big fan of strap locks and these provide more security than a traditional circular end pin at a great price . 
this has been a very good purchase , i have not stopped using it since i got it , good and prompt service as well thanks again cheers !!! 
i do n't know why others rated it as a 4 star . 
it is exactly what it says it is and works fine . 
this is a very basic delay pedal , with the obvious knobs : delay volume , time and repeats . 
it has a nice bright sound , never too muddy and it 's perfect for some dave gilmour style slap back delays.it only works with a power adapter , no battery . 
this has its pros and cons : on one side the pedal has a smaller foot print and costs less , on the other side if your power adapter breaks you 're out of luck!unlike many similar pedals this one does n't let you set infinite repeats : this makes it impossible to make tricks a la johnny greenwood like creating quick loops and changing the delay speed to obtain weird noises . 
this is actually my favorite way of using delay pedals , so i returned it . 
nonetheless , the product itself is great : cheap , sturdy and it does exactly what it 's supposed to do . 
great pedal . 
get it . 
you wont be disappointed for basic delay needs . 
great tone . 
dont waste your $ $ on others with similar specs . 
i like this pick , the hole helps from the pick sliding on your fingers , its not soft or to hard of a pick , , i like it , this holder is rigid , well built , rugged and works great at what it does ... holding my ipad2 . 
i play guitar and like to use my tuner app and scale app , metronome and other apps and having this hold my ipad so i can adjust it and see it clearly where i want it is nice . 
great product , highly recommend . 
this is supposedly a clone of the mi audio crunch box . 
i can not comment on this as i have never played this pedal . 
what i can say however with 30 years playing experience is that this is a very good pedal . 
when one takes into account the price it is a great pedal . 
i own this the classic overdrive and the ultimate overdrive by joyo . 
this has the most distortion . 
it has a nice ragged edge to it and is great for classic to hard rock . 
it does have a bit of noise at high gain but much less than the boss stuff i have had experience with . 
it is solidly built and apprears road worthy . 
great pedal and great value . 
i would have no hesitation buying this or any other joyo product i really like this one as a pre to my fender superchamp x2 head , especially on the distortion channel . 
it really adds some nice tone and lots of overtones ... the only thing to be careful of is the tone knob as that is a huge sweeping circuit . 
i was not able to get it even close to 1/2 way without it being just ugly , but that might be preference . 
also of note is that i ran my fender mustang bass guitar through this -lrb- active pickups -rrb- and i loved the grit that it gave the sound . 
this is a great pedal for the $ $ and it feels heavy and solid like any major brand . 
very nice work joyo , i will be buying more of your pedals for sure . 
this pedal ... i tried it out thru a silver face fender twin ... wow , it cranks , . . ! . . 
it really will produce marshall plexi tones ... especially noticeable in the lower registers ... on the e and a strings ... if you want a marshall stack sound , this is it , , , if you wanty a variety , i would recommend using this in line with one or two other distortions , so you can chose any amp sound you need , , , really people , for these prices i bought one of every pedal these guys make ... and they all are super , , ! 
this pedal is very easy to use ! 
retro sound is rich with harmonics - does have the marshall sound - very satisfied ! 
i 've reviewed several joyo pedals now and have loved almost all of them ... not just because of the price -lrb- $ 40 to $ 50 -rrb- , but also because of their -lrb- apparent -rrb- durability and tone quality that would be appreciated at any price . 
but ultimately , i decided that this is somewhere between a 4 * and 5 * review , and i just ca n't give it the 5 * review i 've given the other joyo products i 've tried out thus far . 
* extremely high output and high sustain * when i first plugged this thing in , i had it set up similar to any other distortion pedal i would try out with my les paul and vox combo amp - with the dials all at 12 o'clock -lrb- 50 % -rrb- . 
big mistake . 
this pedal has an extremely high output . 
depending on the gain setting , i was achieving output parity with the clean signal with the volume set at around 25 % . 
this is n't necessarily a bad thing , and it 's certainly better than having no headroom to set the pedal louder -lrb- a frequent criticism of the boss ds-1 -rrb- , but it 's something to be aware of.also , i read several comments here that this `` is n't a high gain distortion '' . 
i could n't disagree more . 
this thing has tons of gain . 
i think people are thrown off by two things : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the name , which pays tribute to the mi audio crunchbox it clones ; and -lrb- 2 -rrb- the clarity/transparency of the tone , particularly the higher-end range , that shines through at all gain levels . 
`` crunch '' , in my mind , refers to a punchy , cleanish tone that has just a little bit of breakup in its character . 
the crunch distortion has a tone that does n't really breakup or get `` fizzy '' as you turn up the gain , but that 's not what `` gain '' really is . 
the gain knob increases the saturation and sustain of the note -lrb- s -rrb- , but i think people are fooled by the fact that the sound does n't crack up . 
hit a barre chord and see how long the note holds with the gain turned up . 
this actually makes the pedal very useful for lead work , also , which is one of the jf-03 's strengths . 
* the setup is weird , but workable * because of everything i described above , you may use some weird dial configurations to get the tone you want . 
my level is usually around 25 % to 40 % , and is still very loud . 
the `` crunchy '' classic rock tone that other reviewers talked about does exist , but only at around 5 % to 15 % of the gain setting . 
and i had the tone knob generally working from 9 o ' clock to 12 o'clock , as it got a little too bright to go any higher . 
-lrb- again , this is with les paul humbuckers . -rrb- 
ultimately , what i decided was that this pedal has enough bass , not too much in the midrange , and very distinct high end frequencies that come through very clearly . 
if you play gigs and are having trouble cutting through the other instruments , i 'd imagine this pedal would do the trick ! 
* it 's costs less than half of many of it 's true `` competitors '' * while the affordability aspect is distinct from `` quality '' , it can not be ignored . 
part of my initial disappointment was based on a side-by-side comparison with my mxr '78 custom badass distortion . 
the latter did have a fuller sound to it , and was arguably better for rhythm work . 
but that 's an $ 80 custom shop pedal from mxr . 
try comparing this pedal to a $ 40 boss ds-1 or mxr distortion + and it blows them out of the water -lrb- in my opinion -rrb- . 
i 'm not sure want to roll with the crunch distortion being the only dirt box on my board , but if you used it with a specific purpose in mind -lrb- like a lead/gain boost -rrb- , you could afford this and joyo 's excellent `` ultimate drive '' overdrive pedal for still less than most boutique or even boss distortion pedals go for.update - about a week into owning this pedal , i did revise this score from a 5 * to a 4 * rating . 
if you graded the pedal in a `` vacuum '' , i could absolutely see a 5 * rating for the $ 40 price tag . 
but ultimately , there are just a few more problems and quirks about this pedal that i have n't had with other joyo products , so the score should reflect that . 
please note also -lrb- which i did n't realize before -rrb- that the internal trim pot for `` presence '' is not easily accessible unless you are prepared to remove the circuit board and the three jacks that are connected to it . 
a distributor confirmed for me that this is necessary if you want to make the adjustment , and i have no interest in trying to take apart fragile components for a small change that might not even do anything . 
the price is great.the sound is good.the power jack , however , leaves a little to be desired.my standard boss daisy chain power supply cable comes out of this pedal 10x easier than any other pedal.i 've now secured it with tape , so it should be ok.based on other reviews , my guess is that i just got a dud and that most of them are okay . 
this is supposed to be an fulltone ocd clone , but to me , it sounds a bit better than the ocd , and worse.has more low end and a smoother mid that the ocd . 
thought isnt nearly as dymanic as the ocd , that may not be a good thing though , depending on your taste.if i turn the gain up past 9 o'clock , the pedal sounds more like a fuzz than an overdrive , and kills the dynamics.thats a good thing and bad , as i like a fuzz tone , but thats not what i bought the pedal for.overall i can live with it , its well built , sounds good and the price is unbeatable . 
i really liked this one . 
i bought the crunch distortion at the same time and these are complimentary to each other as well as nice standalone . 
i very much like how joyo has reproduced some great sounding pedals for amazingly low prices and seemingly high quality for the average guitarist that just can not afford to spend thousands on these overpriced `` boutique '' pedals . 
i will continue to buy these products from joyo until i find something wrong with them and at present i have nothing to bitch about at all here . 
sound wise this is a big phat heavy sound . 
as an example , this is the jf-02 and jf-03 on guitar and the jf-03 on the bass as well running through the clean channel of a line 6 spider :[ ... -rsb- buy this/these pedals and all things from joyo , they are worth every penny . 
just for the thickness of the sound this little jewel makes , it was worth giving this box a try . 
as someone else previously mentioned , set in a tube breakup setting , this device still is a little fuzzy . 
the tone , none the less , is very usable and sounds great . 
i 'm a happy customer and am sure most anyone else will be as well . 
thanks for reading this . 
people say its an ocd clone . 
it sounds very similar . 
i think it might be slightly rawer around the edges , but its a very subtle thing . 
all in all , i 'm happy with it . 
knobs are very responsive and it offers a wide range of tones . 
good pedal to add . 
i ca n't compare it -lrb- as others have done -rrb- with the ocd , but it simply gives me an overdrive that i love . 
i have several other od pedals : tube screamer , lovepedal kalamazoo and even a cheap danelectro ds-1 . 
the jf-02 is truly my favorite right now . 
i 've been using it with a strat and a les paul clone into either a fender vibro or a small bugera v5 . 
it serves up great tones into either one . 
i revised a previous 4-star review after playing with the joyo british some more and especially after using it for direct line-in recording . 
i now rate it at 5 stars.the phrase `` marshall in a box '' gets thrown around a lot , but usually the people using it have a particular marshall amp in mind . 
for example , the wampler plexi-drive sounds like an older plexi , while a mi audio crunch box will do that 80 's jcm compressed high gain tone . 
on the recommendations of several people , i picked up the joyo british sound hoping it could clone the full spectrum of those different amps.does the british sound succeed at that goal ? 
yes and no . 
on certain settings , the british sound does offer a convincing , tube-like sound reminiscent of a marshall cabinet . 
you can clean it up quite a bit , and it works very well as a `` foundation '' pedal , placed last in your effects chain to give the amp marshall `` character '' , but boosted by other overdrive and distortion pedals . 
-lrb- note : the pedal is actually its own preamp , so the recommended use of it is to plug it directly into the power amp section of a combo amp , or into a pa system or mixer directly . 
you can use it in the effects chain into another preamp , but that will diminish its effectiveness -rrb- but despite those good traits , there 's just a few things `` off '' about it . 
first , it seems to add quite a bit more noise -lrb- `` hiss '' -rrb- than some of the other joyo sound pedals . 
or perhaps it 's just more noticeable due to the fact that this is supposed to be a `` marshall '' , so i turned it up . 
second , as several other reviewers noted , the voice control seems exactly backwards of what it should be - turning clockwise makes it sound thinner . 
on the other three joyo sound pedals , the opposite is true . 
functionally , this really should mean nothing , but it does make it a bit more confusing to dial in.if you read the manual for the tech21 british -lrb- upon which this pedal is supposedly cloned -rrb- , they claim that 9:00 on the voice/character knob would be jtm/bluesbreaker territory , 12:00 would be plexi , and anything above that gives you the `` presence boost of a 70 's metalface '' . 
i have n't tried all those amps , but perhaps it 's meant to brighten up as you turn it up , and that 's just a design choice.i think it 's possible to get the `` marshall '' tone you want out of this thing , but you have to work the eq knobs with each adjustment of the voice knob . 
at this price , hard to complain too much . 
well built.not plastic or cheaply constructed like some pedals out.has a good selection tones and voicing knobs really does a lot to affect sound.simple to use . 
great variety of uses for it . 
i like the layout of controls as well.only bad point for me is the location of the adapter input it 's on the right side , i 'd prefer it to be on the top end like my other pedals . 
other then that nothing i 'd change . 
loyal joyo pedal user . 
they 've got a great product for the price point . 
you wo n't get ac tone from this because your tone is subjective because you are running through another amp head . 
but if you are a tone hound and bored with same sound of same amp , this is an excellent product lifting the voice of your amp . 
sorta like buying a wah , flanger or other product , this essentially will provide another venue to push out tone . 
problem is is that you wo n't replicate a vox sound found on a classic rock album , because what you are producing is a unique sound . 
i have yet to try this through a loop . 
i bought this to tune my 12-string without using the end jack . 
the headstock is angled back the adjustments that this screen makes have made it easier to see and it is sensitive enough &#8220; feel &#8221; the tone of each string with only minor plucking . 
i use it on chromatic but it includes : bass , uke and guitar too . 
easy to use and the clip is sturdy . 
a bit slow compared to the snarks i own but i like it . 
i have been using an app on my cell phone until i purchased this from amazon . 
this thing is awesome . 
it 's so cool that you just clip it from guitar to guitar and not have to worry about plugging anything in to it . 
oh and it turns itself off after 60 seconds of no sound . 
it does get a little sensitive when tuning , in the sense of that it is easy to go past your mark . 
but the more i use it , the better feel i get for it . 
if you do n't have one , get one . 
there are some more compact units out there -lrb- like planet waves -rrb- , and the intellitouch pt10 is a little clearer to read , but this baby is great for the price . 
i leave it on my strat while i play as it can be easily turned on/off as needed and stays relatively hidden behind the head stock . 
the back lighting is clear enough and the tuner is as accurate as my foot switch tuner . 
overall , great deal for the price . 
i bought two for 10 bucks each . 
they work great on my acoustic and electric guitars . 
easy to see , and it centers quickly when tuning , without drifting all over the place . 
the only thing i would do to improve is add an off button . 
there is an on button but the tuner will stay on as long as you are plucking/strumming strings . 
it will turn itself off in one minute if you stop playing , but i usually start right into playing after tuning . 
the only reason to turn it off would be to conserve battery life . 
this is a great little tuner and i am glad i bought it . 
purchased this tuner awhile back to be able to check my tuning periodically without having to access my in line tuner . 
this is a great tuner if you know what you are using it for . 
with that being said , this little clip on is not intended for gig use per say . 
if that is what you are looking for , an inline tuner would be much more efficient and accurate . 
this little guy is best suited to practice -lrb- if you are like me and do n't use your primary rig for at home practice and do n't feel like breaking out the old pedal chain -rrb- it does the job and does it well . 
now could you use it for a gig ? 
sure i suppose so , but bear in mind that it is not an `` in-line '' tuner therefore any excessive background noise will cause the accuracy to be a bit off . 
for the price it ca n't be beat . 
it swivels -lrb- although not much -rrb- but enough that you can clip it on , read the nicely lit lcd and tune up quickly . 
great product that every player should keep in the case with their guitar . 
i purchased the dr-40 for use in field recordings for found sounds and other sampling needs , and it accomplishes that very well . 
the battery life is great , the user interface can be a little confusing at first but is very fluid once you get used to it , and the build quality is pretty solid . 
my only issue is the internal mics , while crystal clear in terms of quality , can sometimes be lacking on the gain side of things . 
in addition , they are very susceptible to wind , even if you just move the recorder while it is recording you will hear a rush of air . 
i highly suggest picking up a wind screen at the same time and save yourself the trouble of having to make another delivery . 
it does a fantastic job . 
i 've had it for almost a year now , still works as well as the first day . 
perfect condition . 
this little fellow is great . 
the proper connection from the focusrite comes with the box . 
hooks to the usb port on my macbook pro . 
everything else plugs right in . 
no hassle with the right jacks and stuff . 
my headphone jack was a different size but i went from 1/8 to 1/4 &#34; with a reducer i had on hand . 
i can turn the computer on and play my guitars without opening a program . 
i 've been recording using garage band . 
works great . 
anytime i can get a product that works as it 's suppose to without a lot of hassle hooking up cables or other stuff , it 's a 5 star in my book . 
oh . 
there are two ports for speakers on the back side i have n't used yet . 
just trying to decide what speakers to purchase . 
i write and record my own music . 
when i upgraded to a new computer with windows 8 it would n't support my m-audio fast track pro so i had to upgrade . 
the focusrite scarlett worked right out of the box . 
i replaced the stock cable with a monster cable and my recordings sound great . 
very easy to use . 
just plug in a microphone or guitar , set your levels , and start rocking . 
this item did the job it 's made for . 
made well and you need to make sure you open it fully prior to inserting it onto your guitar neck to keep it from snapping back on you because it 's strong but it wo n't damage your guitar and it 's effective . 
fender 1a-sx2s-jtxk 10-feet performance series guitar cable ig good stereo cable for guitar or keybord.it 's long enought . 
i recommend it if you need a cord and do n't want to pay a lot , this is a good one . 
i was surprised howsturdy it appears . 
the only part that is not so good is that it is a straight connector nota right angle but it works fine . 
nice looking , nice sound and quality to these cables.they are what i needed!thank you go-dps for making such good quality products . 
does what it 's supposed to do . 
very sturdy feeling . 
pretty sure i could strangle a person with it if i had to . 
i 'm not a dangerous person but you know , when people request wagon-wheel ... . 
i seriously never knew steel guitar picks existed i 've been playing guitar for like 5 years . 
these picks are the bomb ! 
, + they do n't break on you when you strum too hard/fast :d , i would rate this product 6 stars if i could i 'm completely satisfied with these picks!tip : these picks are great for high action/high gain guitar solo 's . 
i play bass with these and they have a unique tone . 
the scratchy surface gives it a really gritty tone for rock music . 
makes rotosound strings really sound off . 
i have not found that they are so hard on strings that the strings were out from use rather than the picks . 
it does take a bit of use to get good with them , but it is worth it for when you need that really growling tone . 
i 've found no issues with noise or build quality so far ; the 1 foot length lets you stagger or make those connections for large pedals or one which put their input/outputs in weird places . 
i 've used this to connect several devices and the colors help . 
i would recommend this and the quality is good . 
what i like about these spongy little things , besides protecting the internals of the mic , is that you can pick a color that reflects your mood according to the song you 're singing . 
just like a pink jail cell works to impart a sense of calm to the incarcerated , so too can a colorful mic cover . 
and my neighbor kids just love 'em during our singalongs ! 
i 'm not going to recommend this over the $ 15 capos . 
it 's better if you spend the extra cash and get one that is well made . 
i decided to try this one out , but the construction of it makes it feel like it 's going to break if i pull it too hard . 
and , because of that , it makes it difficult to put on the guitar neck and also to remove . 
but , once it 's on , it works . 
it seems like such simple concept , but so many companies can not get it right . 
it 's just a spring and a handle , but other companies either use cheap springs that lose tension or charge you an arm and a leg for their name brand.this one worked very well for me and at this price , i am able to have a couple extra lying around . 
i got this because of the price . 
as soon as i opened it , the first thing i noticed was that it feels like it 's not too sturdy . 
i do n't know if it 's going to last me a while . 
but , it does its job . 
works fine on some guitars . 
the neck has to be thinner , though . 
i have to be careful when i put it on , as well as when i remove it . 
i 'd pay for a better one if i had to get another . 
got these because i wanted some extra capos around . 
they work fine and are a great price - they do seem to be a little hard to open -lrb- spring seems a little tight -rrb- . 
good deal as back-up capos . 
this obviously is trying to copy the kyser brand capo , and it does it pretty well . 
feels a bit cheaper , which it actually is both monetary and quality wise . 
the cardboard insert in the package even has the &#34; lifetime guarantee &#34; but no info on where to mail it ; and that 's pretty hilarious that they tried to replicate that aspect , but other than that , it 's a good cheap capo . 
hi folks ! 
ok , this thing is cheap . 
that 's cool . 
but a cheap item you ca n't use is money thrown away . 
before buying this i had read various reviews of some folks liking it and others saying it 's too small . 
well , i want to clear this up once and for all . 
it is too small ! 
specifically , it is too short to reach across all six strings if you go past the third fret or so -lrb- depending on your guitar -rrb- , and it does n't open wide enough to be able be slid down past the third fret , even on a skinny neck . 
this thing really is a puzzler . 
i mean , who the hell would make capos this size , especially when they could 've made capos that actually fit for the same production price and sold them at the same price ? 
someone somewhere is just plain ass stupid . 
however , a positive from this whole mess is that i finally found a capo to use with my ukulele , and for way cheap , ha ha . 
but if you are looking for a capo for a guitar of any size , this is utter garbage . 
cheers ! 
this is thus far a good bargain . 
i have used it to hang a 12 heavy string . 
the arms of it adjust to neck size but when the weight of the guitar pull downward the grip tightlt . 
no chance of falling . 
there are likely better units out there but for the money this one is a steal . 
a ver nice and powerfull product for the mans health really reccomend this item i bough for my primo and he really loves it ! 
it 's hard to find a good clip-on tuner that 's accurate and visible in all situations . 
the snark sn-8 -lrb- b -rrb- is my favorite so far . 
it 's really bright , more accurate that other snarks , and -lrb- despite other reviews saying it breaks easily -rrb- i 've found it to be sturdy enough considering how flexible it is . 
again , it 's a clip-on tuner so do n't expect razor-sharp accuracy . 
but it does a good enough job for what it is . 
it 's quick and convenient . 
if you need something more accurate i recommend investing in a good pedal . 
i 've found the swivel to be a nice feature that makes it easy to see the display . 
i do n't typically use the metronome feature , but it 's nice to have it . 
overall , my favorite snark model and my favorite clip-on tuner . 
not only are they inexpensive , but they hold up very well . 
i have a ton because i keep one on the end of each guitar . 
furthermore , they are very accurate as well . 
so worth it just to not have the hassle of finding a tuner every time i want to change tunings.bottom line : inexpensive , well-made , accurate , time-saving . 
buy it now . 
i have had this for quite some time now and the original battery is still going strong . 
i use it maybe once a week and it tune easily and accurately on both my acoustic and electric . 
great design . 
i cant see how they could improve this at all . 
this tuner really delivers , its inexpensive and accurate , much better than the sn1 . 
do not be fooled by the broader gradients on the sn 8 , if you are in the green , you are in tune . 
sn 8 is also far more reliable , no notorious having to adjust the neck to get a reading as in the sn 1 and 2 . 
i use mine with ukulele and guitars , and both get tuned accurately with it . 
i love these tuners . 
i have tried the intel , krog , boss , etc. . . 
and out of all of them , i like the snark the best . 
response and visual display are awesome . 
unlike a couple of the others i 've used , the snark works well on any place on the headstock . 
a couple of the other brands i had to be careful where i positioned them because they did n't respond well . 
you ca n't go wrong with any snark . 
these tuners just seem ok to me . 
i still have to touch up my guitar when finished with this tuner . 
the accuracy in my opinion just is n't there . 
still nice to have for a quick touch up while practicing . 
the price is right . 
this clip on tuner by snark is fantastic , works great ! 
it alows you to fine tune each string . 
buy it ! 
the display is very readable but you have to be looking atit from a near perpendicular angle . 
maybe i 'm using it wrong but ihave trouble finding anywhere to clip it but my pegs . 
but from there it works great , just have to work to find a peg at the right position to afford a good angle . 
this is hands-down the best tuner i 've * ever * owned . 
the snark sn8 works extremely well , and being chromatic , works on every stringed instrument i own -lrb- guitar , bass , banjo , violin -rrb- no matter what key the instrument is tuned to . 
i still use my korg pitchblack inline with my bass -lrb- also a very nice product -rrb- , but that is mainly to get more cord length across the stage and still keep my signal strong . 
this little baby is amazingly easy to use , and always accurate . 
it has a nice bright easy to read display in any lighting situation and makes tuning a breeze and not a hassle -lrb- just as it should be - i 've personally always hated those boss pedal tuners -rrb- . 
it simply does its job and does it very well.also , buying this item from amazon saved me quite a bit over the local guitar center , which is always a big plus . 
it feels tough too , this thing feels like it can easily handle the rigors of being tossed around , which is a very good thing . 
despite the flimsy way the seller packaged this for shipping , the product arrived intact , and fast . 
i would have cropped a star for a damaged product in that little wimpy envelope they sent it in . 
fortunately mine arrived in perfect condition -lrb- no thanks to that paper envelope - seriously , they should use a stiff cardboard envelope or small tube or something -rrb- . 
i could not be happier , at least until i buy another one to keep at the house while the first stays in my gig bag . 
cheap stands get the job done i have 0 problems so far . 
i 've taken them from new jersey to south carolina i bought a couple of these two years ago . 
they are a sturdy but lightweight stand . 
the small footprint is nice for those with limited space . 
i use for both electric and acoustic guitars . 
i will say that the two i recently purchased are not the same as the ones purchased in 2011 . 
the pictured product is the same but the actual product is not . 
the newer stands have a rear leg that is about half the length as the older model . 
the tubing is smaller on the upright piece and the body support . 
the body support now inserts through the base tube ; the earlier design had a reinforced tube that accepeted the body support piece . 
the rubber feet are also smaller . 
these changes appear to make the newer stand less sturdy and stable , however i believe the stand will be adequate for most full size guitars . 
i did n't notice any offensive rubber odor others have reported . 
there may be a concern about damage to certain finish . 
i would simply wrap the rubber or replace it with an inert material . 
i enjoy playing this thing so much . 
it 's reasonably quiet acoustically , but it shines when plugged in . 
plus is looks good - the actual color and finish are quite rich and shiny , respectively.it stays in tune -lrb- after string break-in -rrb- and the intonation is ok - not spot on but definitely good enough . 
the tuners are basic , but they work well . 
it is thinner than a normal uke , about half the body depth . 
i find holding it without a strap to be harder than a normal sized uke , but with a strap it 's very comfortable.mine came with the pick guard in the bag pocket . 
the bag itself is also pretty basic , but good enough for what it is - a bag to hold your uke and some misc . 
items this is a sweet ukulele and it looks just as sweet as it sounds ! 
change the strings immediately , and you have yourself an excellent sounding instrument . 
amplify it with a touch of chorus and feel it too!only drawback - there is no volume control on the instrument itself.the amp cable that is included is nothing to write home about , and the gig back is a cheap nylon deal - but , it 's all about the instrument , and i give that a 5 . 
* shipping . 
the epiphone comes wrapped in protective foam , inside a gig bag , which is inside a sturdy standard tri-shaped box , which is itself shipped inside a huge box twice its size and totally surrounded by sturdy bubble plastic . 
that huge box is then inside yet another huge box . 
honestly , to protect this better they 'd have had to contact tony stark . 
it would take real skill and intent to damage this thing in shipping . 
excellent job . 
5 stars on that alone . 
* size . 
overall length 24 '' . 
fretboard 10 '' . 
nut to bridge 15 '' . 
so good overall medium-size . 
i like that it 's a bit larger than a 20-21 '' soprano uke . 
it is `` concert '' size -lrb- which i greatly prefer over soprano . 
frankly , i 'd like to see a baritone version -rrb- . 
the 24 '' length is an excellent size for both adult and youth / child fingers . 
* quality . 
from stern to port , this instrument shines . 
beautifully lacquered flawless finish , protective edging , plastic finger-guard -lrb- which itself was guarded in adhesive plastic -rrb- , solid neck screw-joined to heavy-wood body . 
the whole unit is heavy-wood and very durable . 
nevertheless the sound is quite good . 
the tuners are acceptable quality -lrb- nothing amazing , but they work well -rrb- . 
the frets are actual metal and not molded into the fingerboard like cheap ukes . 
the amp-jack is chrome-metal back-plated to the body ; it 's not coming loose . 
strap holders are already mounted , saving users the hassle . 
and of course , the impressive epiphone and les paul signature stamps on the head for sheer class . 
* sound . 
i found this to sound as good as most ukes right out of the box , despite the fact it 's pretty solid-wood electric -lrb- i expected it to sound dull . 
it does n't . -rrb- 
but i still bought a set of d'addario strings -lrb- a brand i 've loved for years -rrb- and according to other reviews here expect the sound to improve significantly once those are added . 
* action . 
i 've rarely seen a purchased instrument that has perfect action off the shelf and this is no exception . 
the action is fairly high -lrb- not uncommon with off-the-shelf instruments -rrb- . 
one will need to remove the strings -lrb- keep them for emergency spares -rrb- , file down the bridge bottom -lrb- easily done with a flat surface and sandpaper -rrb- and add a new set of quality strings . 
i 'm a perfectionist when it comes to action -lrb- as are most players i know -rrb- , so this will be tweaked . 
* durability . 
it 's very durable . 
that counts for the gig bag too . 
no cheap `` tent nylon '' there -- but thick nylon that will really resist tearing . 
as others mentioned i 'd still look for a decent hard case ; they average under $ 40 . 
a good instrument is worth protecting . 
but i 'd say this could take some real punishment and still play well -- not that i 'd go bashing it against a stage floor . 
that would be goofy . 
* weird suggestion : hang on to the box it comes in . 
it makes a great temporary `` hard shell '' case . 
it 's made of rather sturdy cardboard and does a pretty good job of protecting the uke . 
great for hauling around in your car if you ca n't shell out for a shell . 
seriously ... that is some stiff cardboard . 
protects well . 
: -rrb- * electronics . 
the sound is clear . 
sadly there is no volume/tone control , no battery to preamp , and thus the signal to the amp was quite low . 
they could have done better on that end . 
but wow , at this price how can one gripe?two solutions to this :1 -rrb- open up the end plate and totally replace the electronics with something better -lrb- including a tone and volume knob somewhere accessible -rrb- . 
that 's the tricky way .2 -rrb- put a preamp on this . 
you can buy one here on amazon for about 15 bucks . 
if you have a mini-mixer you can do the same thing with that . 
even with that little extra expense you 'll come out ahead.aside from the passive electronics ... this is a prime instrument . 
it is a mid-size uke so you can choose to string it either as a soprano -lrb- if you 're careful and do n't tune it too quickly -rrb- or a baritone -lrb- guitar 4th - 1st string , e-high -rrb- , depending on the strings you choose.considering what you get for the price ... i do n't think this can be beat . 
unfortunately , my extra-long fingers find this very difficult to play ... something i did n't consider when ordering a uke . 
but that 's a physical difficulty and no fault of the instrument . 
the product itself is excellent . 
this is a great deal for two microphone stands . 
they are well constructed and are very flexible ; can be used with an instrument or just as an ordinary microphone stand . 
several adjustment areas allow the perfect height/positioning . 
these should last a long time as long as they 're not abused . 
this microphone stand it a fairly good buy . 
because it is a light and portable stand , it is not built to be fully extended with microphones , such as the behringer xm1800s . 
adding a counter weight maybe needed if you have a heavier condenser microphone . 
i found that i needed to line up one of the legs directly under the boom when it was fully extended . 
as it stands , i would suggest this as a fairly good deal . 
i expected cheap mic stands missing a few things that more expensive ones had . 
to be honest , i 'm not missing anything . 
they have all the features and versatility you 'll ever need . 
perfect for what i want to do . 
they even come with a clamp for your cable . 
i got these recently . 
a local music shop was wanting $ 80 per stand so couldn &#8217; t believe the price of these . 
was expecting cheap and very plastic and was very pleasantly surprised . 
great quality an very robust . 
i wanted p-90 pickups . 
they do make noise kind of like an old album . 
once you start playing you do n't notice it though . 
other than that the guitar stays tuned and is a blast for a beginner like me to bang around on . 
it looks really good ! 
these were just what i needed . 
over the years , some of the bridge pins on my 12-sttring acoustic guitar have broken and had to be replaced . 
some of them had the white dot , some did n't , therefore , they did n't look uniform . 
with these pins , the guitar now looks like it did when i bought it . 
thank you . 
james edward -lrb- bat -rrb- owens i 've been using this amp for a few months and i 'm very pleased with the overall quality and performance . 
i was looking for a small studio amp and watched the demo video on youtube . 
i ordered it through amazon and it arrived quickly . 
the amp has two shades or flavors as i call it . 
i only use the clean side or input one . 
this is what fender calls blaceface clean . 
no matter how hard you push that channel it wo n't break up and sounds great with no fx 's running . 
i really have n't used channel two much . 
these are all your pre-sets which many amps are doing these days . 
i 'm pretty much old school and like to find my own sound . 
however they do sound very good and you can change a lot of these settings both from the front panel and through your computer . 
the amp itself hooks right into your usb connection such as gargeband or other recording boards or software . 
the amp is all tube and sounds better the longer you leave it on ... it 's a loud 15 watts ... i have used this amp on smaller gigs without any problems . 
if your looking for a studio/home/1st amp you ca n't go wrong with this guy . 
it 's now my go to amp in the studio . 
you can make this amp sound many different ways and with an fx chain in front of channel one -lrb- how i run it -rrb- the sky is the limit . 
have n't used the software that you need to download from fender but will look at it later . 
right now this amp does n't need to be tweaked for me ... i loved it right out of the box ! 
give it a test drive and let your ears decide ... i have owned many solid state and modeling amplifiers , including a few of the vox valvetronix series . 
however , this is both my first fender amp , as well as my first true &#34; tube &#34; amp . 
first , some clarification is needed on &#34; tube &#34; vs. &#34; modeling &#34; amp . 
the fender super champ x2 is absolutely a tube amp - it has one 12ax7 and two 6v6 's , and they are involved in both the preamp and power amp stages . 
however , the amplifier has a modeling component on top of that true tube tone , which is what allows it to project different &#34; voices &#34; . 
contrary to what some posters have written , channel 1 does also have some front-end modeling , accept that the the model is fixed for &#34; blackface &#34; tone and controlled by a separate volume know -lrb- no gain control -rrb- . 
channel 2 offers 16 different &#34; voice &#34; presets and 10 of these model a variety of vintage fender amplifiers , including the tweed deluxe , bassman , deluxe , princeton , and twin . 
settings 9-15 model a variety of other popular amps , including the vox ac30 and marshall.overall , i found the available tones to be excellent . 
unlike my valvetronix , where i more or less settled on a particular setting and used it at all times , i could really see myself flipping between the different models and seeing how they respond to different guitars . 
one thing that should be noted if you plan on changing models frequently - you may have to adjust volume , gain , bass , and treble to dial in the same amount of volume as you move from amp to amp . 
however , i found the levels to be much more uniform in output than in other amps with a modeling component . 
also , the x2 does not suffer from a lot of the excess noise or &#34; hissing &#34; you hear with digital modeling amps.the tones that come out of the 10 &#34; speaker of the super champ x2 are very rich and touch-responsive , as you 'd expect from a tube amp . 
the amp has tons of high-end sparkle , but some of the settings only start to open up if you increase the volume -lrb- true of many amps -rrb- . 
the stock speaker , which is fender 's own design -lrb- and has a ceramic magnet , i believe -rrb- , is frequently criticized as a weak point . 
however , it is certainly passable and if you are new to tube amps -lrb- or only intend on playing at bedroom levels -rrb- , you 're unlikely to take issue with it . 
the eminence ragin ' cajun is a commonly suggested replacement that apparently adds significant amounts of output and low end . 
but , again , the amp is plenty loud and full-sounding for its size . 
better intended for home/studio use than most gigs , but it excels at what it does.that brings us to the effects section and the fender fuse software that works with the amp via usb cable . 
frankly , i 'm not a fan of most on-board effects with combo amplifiers . 
i prefer to use pedals for modulation , delay , and some overdrive/distortion . 
the good new is that the on-board reverbs -lrb- which include spring , room , hall , and a few others if you install them from the software -rrb- are quite good . 
you can also reassign the presets to different effects . 
so , if you want a flanger with a reverb , you can have a setting for that . 
if you want a different type of delay mixed with a particular reverb , you can do that too . 
the tap tempo button is a great modern convenience to go with those effects . 
but , as i said , while they represent a good value for players that do n't want to invest in pedals , i 'm more likely to use my boss dd-3 than the on-board delay , and so on.the build quality of the super champ x2 is largely excellent . 
the grill is wound tightly and with the same convincing shimmer of some of fender 's more expensive amps . 
the amp weighs in at 24 pounds and is extremely portable with the handle on top . 
one thing i did note , however , is that the knobs protrude and seem like they would be very easy to damage while transporting , so i will have to be careful about that . 
also , there are a couple of seams for the tolex material on top of the amp that look like they could have been hidden better . 
but overall , the amp looks very well constructed . 
i was initially concerned about the digital aspects taking away from the tube amp aesthetic , but everything is mapped to vintage-looking knobs , and from a few feet back , the amp looks just as much at home in the 60 's as it does post-2000 . 
overall , i think this is an excellent value and a quality amp that i hope to enjoy for years to come . 
i 'm only really scratching the surface of its potential , but it makes great fender tone sound easy . 
the fender fuse software could be a little more intuitive to work with , and i wish there were a better way to know what each of the voice and f/x settings correspond to without consulting a chart . 
but it 's a great little amplifier that 's all the power you 'd need for hobbyists and studio recording , and it could probably handle some smaller gigs as well . 
i love this tuner . 
it is accurate & very reasonably priced . 
i have ordered this tuner for fellow musician friends & all of them love them . 
best clip on tuner i have ever purchased . 
will work on any instrument . 
you do n't need the expensive ones , this works just fine . . 
just wish the batteries lasted longer ! 
let the testimony of my repeated purchases be your guide . 
the batterry that come with it lasts an average of 6 -9 months - a new battery will last over a year - i get replacements at local cvs - savon store i was hesitant to purchase this , as i really like the display of the previous models . 
at first it seems like it might be less accurate . 
it has less granularity in the display for example . 
however , it does seem to respond noticeably faster . 
it appears to be a bit more sensitive and better at tuning bass notes . 
and it may in fact be more precise , though it takes learning how to work with the display.on earlier snarks , the display has individual tiny gradients for each cent of pitch above or below the note . 
and they seemed pretty dead on , especially if you tune from the harmonic at the middle of the string . 
but i also found that the note would occasionally stall briefly causing me to over-tune . 
-lrb- though once you get used to it , it is easily avoided . -rrb- 
anyway , on this unit , i am not sure what each bar represents , but it is very sensitive . 
if the string is not quite perfect , the `` on pitch '' bar will be lit up , but so will one next to it . 
then a slight turn of the tuning peg will bring it right on . 
then only the `` on pitch '' bar will be lit -lrb- unless you turn too far -rrb- . 
and the result sounds really right . 
i have several snarks . 
they are the first tuner my young guitar students have no problems with . 
fast and accurate . 
the sn-8 is a little faster and slightly more accurate than the other , older models , with a brighter display -lrb- at slightly reduced battery life -rrb- but they are all great . 
i have lots of tuners , and several brands of clip ons . 
this is my favorite . 
there is no close second . 
i play 5 string bass in a band and at church as well as guitar . 
i love this tuner . 
it seems redundant to review again accept to point out i have bought more and will buy more . 
i will have one for every instrument stored with and actually on each guitar inside it 's case . 
i have given out 5 and kept 4 - i have 11 working guitars - i need 7 more snarks ... . 
some have had their batteries run down in under a year - but i get close to 2 years off a new battery - -lrb- batteries are a bit costly -rrb- i 've used this tuner for both my acoustic guitar and banjo for a year now and like them a lot . 
we got this one for my wife 's mandolin . 
it 's small , barely noticeable from the front and easily visible from the back . 
i understand it can be a tight fit on some headstocks , it 's snug on my 12 fret slot-head guitar due to the buttons pointing straight down but it works ok for me . 
the accuracy is as good or better than any i 've used.pros : accuratecheapeasy to see in daylight or darkgood battery lifeit 's always there , you do n't have to hunt for a tuner.cons : i wish it would turn the tuner buttons for me ! 
i had one of these and lost it , replaced it with the ns planet waves micro clip on tuner , which is not as good . 
this tuner has a better , higher contrast display which is needed for bright outdoor gigs . 
it works more predictably and tunes smoother than the micro too . 
easily worth the extra dollar . 
it 's a little taller than the micro , but still very small and if it 's behind a headstock it does n't make a difference visually , the main difference is the height if the tuner , width and depth are about the same . 
that also means a bigger readout . 
so not really a con . 
i use it on a godin with a slotted headstock , positioned so i can see it between the tuning keys . 
easy to use , bummed i lost it and replaced it with an inferior tuner , i 'll be getting another one of these soon ... should probably pick up one for every guitar and be done with it . 
i bought a classical guitar and then realized that i needed on of the around the neck with a sound hole hook type straps . 
bought one and due to past neck surgery , found that strap painful to wear after a few minutes . 
later saw this one and decided to try it . 
works perfect , really adjustable , and no pressure on my neck -lrb- since it does n't go around your neck -rrb- . 
great design ! 
very nice classical guitar strap . 
i have used this style of strap for over forty years with traditional style classicals that do not have strap buttons . 
do n't expect it to work like a strap on a standard acoustic or electric guitar . 
this is designed to only hold the guitar in position while you are playing it . 
it will not hold the guitar if your hands are not on it . 
this is the way this type of strap is made to work , and is certainly not a design flaw as some reviewers have suggested . 
holds my cordoba in position perfectly . 
installed these on my schecter c-1 hellraiser . 
i had very high hopes for these , but as with any new over-hyped technology , they failed to impress me . 
the only good thing i have to say is the tone is good . 
but realistically it is no where near a drastic difference to regular strings . 
you would barely be able to hear the difference in a side by side comparison . 
so now that i have wasted almost double the price on these it gets worse . 
they are not silky smooth feeling as advertised . 
if anything they feel worse than regular strings . 
last but not least : they are bad for frets . 
just like stainless strings ; harder metal against nickel frets is going to wear them out real quick . 
i do n't know about anyone else but i do n't want to have my guitar re-fretted every 2 years.for the very miniscule difference in tone they are not worth the extra money or equipment wear and tear . 
not great but not bad as well . 
the base strings feel really strange when sliding . 
the 6th string and the 1st string were cut while i was playing so i had to change them the second day i installed them . 
bending feels easy . 
i love these strings . 
i get a much higher output , much better response and much better sound . 
great strings for just a little more . 
i 've tried other strings with the jackson with no luck -lrb- what a stupid guitar to string -rrb- anyway i like the sound they do seem to carry better , if only a little . 
the texture seems to be a bit rougher but i 'm sure they will be fine to play once broken in . 
pulse there rocksmith endorsed lol . 
we got this for my young son who enjoys reading in his bed prior to going to sleep at night . 
he really likes this light and it is bright enough for him to read by , but not too bright that it hurts his eyes . 
a good buy . 
i could see where this could be useful in other applications , like on a music stand , but it also makes a great reading lamp attached to a bed . 
this little dude does a great job . 
the clip works great on my music stand and the light itself has a bright display and a dimmer display to save batteries . 
i highly recommend . 
i can sit in a completely dark room and see the music fine ! 
i am a `` newbie '' to the world of playing the blues harp ; however , i am not a beginner to music . 
i have played guitar fervently for the past 22 years , so i knew a little something when i thought i would try to learn the harmonica . 
technique is of utmost importance and i found learning how to pucker and tongue block on this instrument was effortless . 
it sounds , for the most part , in tune and its tone is great . 
my kids love to hear me play it ! 
however , there is 1 `` con '' to this wonderful instrument . 
after owning it for several days , the draw 2 hole went flat . 
i researched this and found that poor technique would likely be the culprit ... so i worked on my technique some more . 
to my dismay , the one note on the harmonica that allows you to bend into 2 other tones , and is considered the `` sweet spot '' of the instrument , did not work right . 
obviously you can not take it back to the seller - it 's not really his/her fault . 
i am not sure how to repair it , but i feel that i should have to do so this early in the game . 
maybe it 's my naivete ' in hoping for a perfect instrument . 
so , i took one star away because of this problematic issue . 
otherwise , i really like this harmonica . 
you ca n't go wrong with aquila . 
amazing song , very warm strong tone also carries a nice volume too.long lasting , made with quality . 
improves the sound greatly on less expensive ukes in other wordsit can make a 50 dollar uke sound like a 100 dollar uke ! 
i have three uku , soprano , concert -lrb- love the best -rrb- and a tenor , , this brand of strings rocks . 
enjoy i bought this brand because i have one of their mic stand mounts -lrb- for iphone -rrb- which i like a lot.pros : the clips did a good job holding my ipad mini without having to remove the folio type cover -lrb- marware axis -rrb- . 
quality seems acceptable for the price , the ball swivel works well.cons : it 's too heavy for my mic stands . 
i tried it on the boom arm and it made it top-heavy and unstable . 
if the boom is positioned in a very upright position it 's ok , but a boom pointed up defeats the purpose!the clamp which holds the base to the stand is big and cumbersome.i had high hopes for this one but it 's not going to work for me . 
i have returned it and ordered a different chargercity model , the one with the lever-type mount . 
i switched over to using an android tablet for notation when playing music . 
all of my 7 &#34; tablets fit and even my larger hp touchpad fits . 
i ended up using an ainol fire as my regular tablet . 
it would be nice if there was just a tiny bit more tilt up but it does what it is supposed to and it fits securely on the mic stand . 
this joyo jf-34 us dream distortion box is very well made and produces a good range of distortion affect . 
my son has taken up playing guitar about a year or so ago and now that he is past the basics he was interested in trying different techniques . 
this box can be set to make minimal distortion or maxed out to produce very heavily distorted effects.the box is very good quality , with nice large controls and metal foot switch . 
the unit can be powered with a 9v battery or via an external power source -lrb- not included -rrb- . 
this is a fun way to add distortion effects for guitar players.highly recommended!cfhnote : manufacturer provided unit for review but that in no way influences my rating or comments . 
reading the product description may give you an idea about this product . 
i received , plugged it in and was impressed with the clean yet great sounding distortion . 
it 's solid , well made and looks/feels like it can handle the world tour.get it ! 
reputedly the joyo us dream is a copy of the suhr riot distortion pedal . 
after watching a side by side comparison on youtube , i decided to buy one.i would describe the us dream as sounding like a bright proco rat with a little less sustain and a much tighter low end . 
it has an mxr style enclosure -lrb- that means you have to remove the back plate to change batteries -rrb- and a surprisingly narrow sweet spot . 
but for $ 48 dollars i 'm happy with purchase . 
if you do n't like too much dirt in your tone , this might be the pedal for you.the sweet baby is a low gain overdrive pedal that is also on the bright side tonally.if you have a fairly clean single channel amp , it wo n't give you the full crunch or theextra sustain specially at low bedroom levels . 
however , if you set your tube amp towhere it just starts to break up or is already cooking , step on this pedal and you 'll be rewarded . 
if you like the sound of the dirt channel on your amp , set the gain low and boost it with this pedal . 
the notes ring clear with the extra bite , and brightness to cut thru the mix ... sweet ! 
you can use it like a tubescreamer although the sweet baby does n't color your sound . 
-lrb- no mid-hump -rrb- i use it to boost my barber direct drive , ocd and the dirt channel on my amp.the pedal is housed in a metal casing and looks well made . 
it 's not noisy even when you stack it with other overdrives . 
instead of a tone knob , it has a `` focus knob '' which controls your picking dynamics and presence . 
all the way to the left , the sound is smooth with a tone that sounds like you turned off the presence control on your amp . 
all the way to the right , when you pick the strings hard , it gives you that bite as well as the brighter presence . 
the pedal is very transparent , smooth and touch sensitive and cleans up well.you ca n't get a bad sound because there is not a lot of knobs to mess with.this pedal basically takes the sound of your amp , adds a little gain with very little compression and gives you picking control . 
i just wish it had more gain so you can go from blues to hard driving rock with a twist of a knob . 
at a fraction of the cost of the boutique pedal it was patterned after , it 's a no brainer . 
i 'm sold . 
i 've purchased several joyo pedals and all of them are built extremely well and perform as good as if not better than top name pedals . 
let me just start out by saying that i 've been playing guitar for over 30 years and have owned a lot of different pedals over all this time . 
i still own most of these units accept for this one ... the joyo compressor . 
my setup is a very simple one ... starting with a stratocaster to compressor , wah-wah , super-overdrive , boost pedal , delay , then straight into the front end of a tube amp with reverb & vibrato . 
i do n't want to get into a long blown out history of all the compressor pedals i 've tried over the years but i know why you want one and how to use them . 
this thing simply did n't work right out of the box . 
while the outside of this stomp box is all metal , the inside is full of very low grade parts from china . 
loose wires and bad components were everywhere on the board . 
i ended up sending it back for a full refund . 
i do n't in anyway blame the seller . 
they took care of me without a hitch and i would buy from them again ... just nothing with the name joyo on it . 
if you 're only buying these based on price i would say buyer beware ... you get what you pay for . 
it could use a little more on the sustain side like my mxr , but it does what it is supposed to . 
although this is a very solid feeling pedal and the output and sustain knobs worked , the attack knob -lrb- the control for how much compression you want to apply -rrb- did absolutely nothing . 
i even checked it in my recording software by looking at the waveforms and there was no change at all regardless of the attack setting.perhaps my pedal was a rare defective one , but none-the-less i returned the pedal back to amazon and will search for another compression solution for my pedal board . 
i 've had this for almost a year . 
while i 'm no stranger to compression as far as recording and pro audio goes , i have n't used a compressor pedal since washburn made that really janky , noisy compressor pedal in the late 80 's . 
i have never used a ross , so the fact that this is supposedly a clone did n't have any influence over my decision to buy the joyo . 
i will say that it 's not a pedal that should be reviewed the first time you use it . 
sure , i love to love my gear right out of the box just like others do , but compression takes time to dial in , even if you are familiar with it . 
that said , i finally love this pedal and feel that i can accurately say that it has made a tremendous improvement in keeping my signal tamed when going from clean to overdrive/distortion . 
i bought it mainly because i play in a rush cover band , and the harmonics at the beginning and end of red barchetta sounded flat and lifeless until i got the joyo dialed in . 
compression is n't the easiest affect to dial in , but once you 're there , you can pretty much leave it set as long as you 're using similar pickups if you happen to switch guitars . 
great pedal once you get it dialed in . 
take your time and you will probably be as happy with it as i am . 
this one sounds a bit nasal , and thin on guitar . 
i tried it on bass , and it gives you that big raw , ad thick stoner metal bass sound . 
i like it ! 
ok pedal. , , , , it does very good at bedroom volume , , , , , but at cranked marshall stage volume , i do not like it , , , it does not play well then , , , the octave gets crazy . . 
and screamy , , the fuzz becomes irritating at loud volumes ... , , , i got a bonamassa fuzz face , , , end of search , , , this pedal provides the classic octave distortion i sought after . 
for the price and product quality you ca n't go wrong with this one . 
and the functionality is great ! 
use it as a fuzz/distortion independently or switch on the octave up for the classic jimi hendrix like tones and harmonics this device sounds okay , its usable . 
but you should plan ahead if you 're in the usa and want one , it ships from mainland china , it takes a while to get to the states . 
definitely worth the $ 40 . 
if you are looking for a literal octave pedal this ai n't it . 
this is a good old school fuzz monster , and when combinations of notes are played , most notably an interval of a 4th on the lower strings it creates an overtone series that has a subtle octving affect . 
i 've used this pedal to put some growl in my bass , kind of an e.h. bass balls sound . 
i love this it 's do fun to play with . 
every pedal that i buy of joyo amaze me . 
they are well built with a sound that is beautiful for that price . 
i 'm sold out on joyo pedals . 
the neck is well made . 
the fit . . 
it was press fit to my body like they were made at the same time.i did have to sand the neck a little , it had a bump in it . . 
the frets are a little sharp but not as bad as most . . 
it took some time to get so if you in a tight build time i might look at getting somthing thats made in the states !! 
came in oversized boxes but were packaged securely and easy to set up and hold my guitar and bass right out of the box , this is a solid stand , with good adjustability and a thick , decent quality foam to cushion your guitar/bass ... its only fault is its price . 
amazon sells cheaper versions that are just as good . 
simply search for guitar stands on here and see for yourself . 
to my mind there are three criteria for evaluating a capo :1 -rrb- it 's got to hold with enough even pressure to keep all the open stringsringing clearly , especially in the face of hard picking , strumming , and string pulling .2 -rrb- the design should n't intrude on either my thumb when it 's behind the neck or peeking over the fingerboard , or the side of my index finger when i 'm at the first fret playing chords or single notes .3 -rrb- the design should n't require excessive hand pressure or too much fussiness to apply , reposition , and remove the capo -lrb- especially two-handed fussiness -rrb- . 
the tri-action capo scored big on all three criteria : it held tight on a variety of acoustic and electric neck widths and profiles , from a martin om-1 with a wide rounded shape to a gibson l4 archtop with a baseball bat-thick and round neck , a skinny sg , a wide and soft c-profiled ibanez artist , and an imitation strat with a hard-radiused fingerboard and classic c-shaped neck.planet waves came up with a design that works both `` over and under '' : i can squeeze the capo with my fingers with its back snug in my palm or flip it over and use the base of my thumb , making it effortless to position , adjust and remove.the capo 's profile is comparable in size to the keyser , but without the keyser 's protruding high angle arm neccessary to generate adequate spring tension . 
i 've used the keyser for years and in my opinion the tri-action is far easier to apply.the tri-action is also much less conspicuous from the front , although it 's not quite as compact as the schubb or those fancy minimalist capos some flatpickers like -lrb- i like them too but they 're a little more work than i sometimes want -rrb- . 
what 's remarkable about the tri-action is its spring tension that 's truly comfortable to apply yet produces a more than adequate string grip . 
the spring wire is probably 1/16 '' thick and i ca n't imagine it ever losing its tension . 
the adjusting screw wheel is about a quater-inch wide and textured for an easy touch.the purpose of the tension wheel is not to vary the distance between front and rear capo surfaces , as is the case with some other brands , but to vary the pressure exerted by the rear surface against the neck - and consequently the amount of pressure required to squeeze the capo . 
the bottom line is you can custom-fit the capo to your hand strength and avoid straining or worse - a painful palm cramp like the one i got on stage once while squeezing the keyser.the pick holder is also nicely designed : a kind of serrated slit that lets you securely stash a pick at varying depths , equating to how easy it is to pull it out . 
i think my pockets serve the same purpose even more securely , but it 's a nice touch.i did n't think there was a whole lot of room left for re-engineering the largely utilitarian guitar capo , but clearly a lot of thought went into planet waves ' ns tri-action capo - enough to easily knock my previous go-to capo right off its pedestal.get one , and sit back and watch the banjo guys sweat when the fiddler calls for `` done gone '' in bb at that next jam session . 
the planet waves capo looks like it should work a lot better than it did . 
i tried it on several guitars and made direct comparisons with several other capos . 
i used this capo on a gibson j40 , hummingbird and a j-200 . 
i played it finger style and strummed with a pick . 
the device is very well made and really looks like the best capo i own . 
however , the sound left something to be desired . 
there was fret buzz and the notes sounded lifeless , unless i really cranked down on the adjustment - then is was still dull , but passable . 
it was a little better on electrics - i tried it on a les paul and a telecaster - it was ok , but not the best of the bunch . 
i do like the built in pick holder . 
to compare this i tried a g7 capo , kaiser and schubb . 
frankly , the only one i really am happy with is the schubb . 
i did some research on capos and decided to give planet waves a try . 
i previously had one of those bungie cord like capos , which was fine but it is a bit cumbersome.the other capos i looked into were kyser and schubb . 
kyser is great because of its easy trigger grip . 
it 's disadvantage however is that it has a lot of weighted tension on one side so it can knock your strings out of tune . 
the schubb deals with this issue by having an adjustable tension spring that will adjust pressure according to the thickness of the neck . 
the problem with the schubb , however , is that it ca n't really be manipulated with one hand and it can easily fall of the guitar.in comes the planet waves . 
it has a trigger grip so technically you can easily move it around the fretboard . 
however , because of the adjustable tension , you do need to adjust it when moving to a different neck thickness . 
it might rule out the one-handed ease but it does take care of schubb 's problem of falling off . 
in reality , i only found that i need to adjust the tension when switching between guitars or if i move up way up the fretboard . 
between the 1st and 5th fret , i do n't really need adjust . 
however , if for some reason i want to capo at the 7th , i do need to adjust the tension because it 's too tight . 
in all , it 's not that big a deal and it 's nice to have the option to adjust the capo.in all , i 'm happy . 
no capo is perfect . 
you can do partial capos with this one . 
another review complained that it created buzz but all you need to do it adjust the tension.in case you are n't aware , this particular capo model only works on six string steel guitars . 
i have an electric guitar , a nylon and a recording king ros-06 with a chunky neck . 
works great on the electric with the skinny neck and the ros-06 with that chunky neck . 
since the capo was built for guitars with a radius fretboard , it does not work on classical guitars -lrb- or anything with a flat fretboard -rrb- . 
the capo will not reach across the entire fretboard and since the cap is curved , it will not apply pressure on the middle strings.it 's a nice capo but it may not be what you 're looking for so i recommend looking into the other two big hits in capos . 
i dont know what all the hype is over this thing . 
the idea is good and its cute . 
its for kids and metal heads that want to play screaming guitar but not blow the windows out . 
how many of these types of noise boxes do we need ? 
not only for the price you need to have a speaker cabinet to go with it . 
go buy a 20 watt roland cube at least you can play some clean guitar also . 
or any combo little amp . 
it 's for bedroom use only . 
you have a external power supply to hook up to it then you need a speaker wire . 
being light weight as it is also if you move around with your guitar you will pull it off the speaker cabinet and drag it around the stage with you . 
just get a distortion pedal at least it stays in one spot . 
i have checked this amp out twice , once with an orange ppc112 and once with the 8 &#34; version , with both a strat and a les paul , and i am very disappointed in this amp.now admittedly , with the high output buckers on the les paul the pre-amp breaks up nicely and the tone is really sweet with the gain on 5-7 , however the bottom line is that there is simply not enough clean headroom in this amp to produce any worthwhile volume with clean or mild crunch tones.so , without any volume with clean tones this amp becomes a one trick pony and hence so very very disappointing ... bottom line : unless you want full on distortion 100 % of the time , you are better off with a clean amp and distortion pedal than this gutless amp ... . 
if you are committed to orange -lrb- and boy do they make some stunning amps -rrb- go check out the dark terror ... what a good buy ! 
this gig bag is nicely made , looks great , and the padding is really nice . 
luv the zip pocket in the front - perfect for strap , snark , capo , whatever . 
bought this for my hubby 's tenor uke and one just like it -lrb- ` tho smaller -rrb- for my concert uke . 
highly recommend . 
inexpensive and compares favorably with my more expensive tuners . 
angle is not as adjustable as a snark but tuner works well . 
i love this little tuner . 
it is smaller than i thought it would be . 
it weighs next to nothing , is accurate , and easy to read with its bright large display . 
it is universal for different string instruments by pressing the botton on the back . 
the only part of the display that is very small is the one that tells you what instrument it is set for , but that was not a big enough issue for me to subtract points for . 
liked the fact it tunes your ukulele as i must be tone deaf and cant use pitch pipes , , i bought another for my step son . 
i did have a problem with mine not turning on one time but after re-seating the battery it has not had a problem since . 
this 6-pack of guitar patch cables are great for chaining guitar effects pedals and the short lengths helps to reduce cable `` spaghetti mess '' . 
these are well made cables with 90-degree connectors , which is exactly what we needed.highly recommended!cfh they work great with my pedals ! 
not sure if it 's the pedals or the cords , but i noticed with my full rig and using all the cords there is a noticeable hum in the background . 
i 'm sure a noise gate could solve that problem , but oh well . 
i can deal with it . 
they all work and none of them have given any trouble . 
my pedal arrangement stays loose and the whole thing gets moved and jerked around -lrb- a lot -rrb- . 
i would have liked them to be a little bigger in diameter but for the price they work great . 
no regrets , rock on ! 
these patch cables have worked well and done their job just fine for me but when they arrived they smelled really strongly like band-aids ... kind of a gross plastic smell . 
the smell did go away some but it made me not want to touch them much at first . 
for an $ 8 item , you ca n't go wrong . 
i used it on a violin to test out some amps at a guitar center . 
it seems very sensitive and transmits a clear tone . 
when i originally went out to place this order , i was planning to order the tc electronics singles voicetone c1 vocal effects processor for its pitch correction function . 
as i looked over that device and some alternatives , i finally ordered the tc-helicon mic mechanic because it had pitch correction and some other very nice effects . 
i ignored the reviewers who said the pitch correction function had no affect - how could tc electronics put out the &#34; mic mechanic &#34; with a pitch correction function that did n't do anything ? 
well , those reviewers were right - the pitch correction function has no affect ! 
also , i could n't see any affect between engaging/disengaging the tone button . 
i kept the mic mechanic because i like the other effects , but i 'm very disappointed in the primary reason i bought it ! 
i purchased this to add basic effects to a small pa based on daisy-chainedpowerwerks pw50 portable pa systemheads and got a lot more than i bargained for.the effects are beautifully done . 
reverb sounds natural and there is a wide range of choices for both reverb and echo . 
for the record i keep mine set at club with the wet/dry knob set to a straight 12 o'clock position . 
wet means more of the affect and dry means less.there is a mic gain on the left side of the unit , and the mic input -lrb- xlr only -rrb- has phantom power . 
the xlr out goes straight to your mixer . 
there is also a usb port for software i do not use so i can not speak to that feature.the unexpected bonus on this device is the tone feature , which i leave on . 
it adds a dimension to vocals that does not interfere with them , not does it altar them in ways that are mechanical sounding - you can set it for minor to major pitch correction . 
i suspect that most folks will want less of this than more.overall this is a perfect addition to a vocalist 's toolbox because it is straightforward to use and relatively inexpensive . 
it 's also perfect for adding vocal effects to small , bare-bones pa systems . 
it transformed mine from essentially a loudspeaker to a true pa. . 
if you only want to use this thing as a detune affect to add a static , non-oscillating , chorus like affect , it 's fine for that . 
as an actual pitch shifter though , this thing is awful . 
all the pitch shift settings sound like they 're 30 cents sharp . 
this is especially awful sounding when used as an octave affect . 
i suppose i could have opened it up to see if there was an adjustment pot inside but i did not want to void the warranty so i just returned it . 
it 's hard to believe that nobody at the company could hear how badly out of tune this pedal is . 
i 've read the same complaint about their pure octave pedal also . 
this is really too bad because all the other pedals for mooer seem to be quite good . 
i own their reecho delay pedal and quite like it and i 'm also tempted to get their green mile pedal.if you 're not that sensitive to pitch inaccuracies , this pedal maybe fine for you but i doubt that many will find this pedal to be satisfactory.one minor quibble about the rubber padding used at the bottom of these pedals . 
it does not stick to the adhesive on any of the velcro strips i 've tried to use . 
i play using this device . 
it is portable , so i always have it with me . 
i tune the a to 432 , and this works well for that . 
has a tuner and a metronome . 
what 's not to love . 
best to carry a cable to plug into the guitar , unless you are in a quiet area . 
it is sensitive , and will pick up ambient sounds to give false readings . 
this is a good thing : it 's sensitive . 
very versatile power supply and much cheaper than others . 
this is not true isolated outputs , but it is quiet and that is what counts . 
i have the fuel tank chameleon and i end up using this because it fits the needs of the pedals on my board the best , mainly because of the 500ma output . 
here is a comparison of the jp-02 , chameleon , and the onespot . 
i have all three.t-rex fuel tank chameleon -lrb- 1350ma -rrb- outputs 1-3 : 9v/12v 300maoutput 4 : 9v/18v 150maoutput 5 : 9v/12v 300ma | -- use 5 or 6 only , not bothoutput 6 : 12v ac 300majoyo sp-02 -lrb- 1000ma -rrb- outputs 1-7 : 9v 100maoutput 8 : dc 9v maximum output of 500maoutput 9 : dc12v 100maoutput 10 : dc18v 100mavisual sound onespot -lrb- 1700ma 9v only -rrb- daisy chain power into 8 pedals not exceeding 1700ma well , it 's a solid chunk of metal . 
the lights on it are either all on or all , off , so they are useless to me.you can power any lightweight 9v , 12 , or 18v stompbox with this . 
just watch the milliamps because i do n't think this can deliver much more than a few hundred per box.my only issue with it is that the included patch cords are all the same length . 
would have been nice to have a few really long ones.it is more expensive than a one spot , but i guess this is a neater solution and at the very least , i can actually use my all the stompboxes i want now . 
joyo makes great quality products cheap . 
i love this product it works great . 
all my pedals hove there own power supply if you are ordering these to replace one or two of your gibson speed knobs , you will want to replace all four because they are not identical to gibson 's . 
in all fairness , these could possibly be better than gibson 's stock , seem to be made with a more solid underside , but the numbers are a little bit smaller.this is the only reason i gave them four stars.fit perfectly on cts potentiometers and if you replace all four of them , nobody accept you will know ! 
- lol.all four of mine were fine with no apparent flaws or defects , as opposed to other reviews.if you get these and they are n't perfect ... send them back until you get a perfect set ! 
it 's free!hope this helps ... not much else to say ! 
i wanted to find a device that let me record easily when at a gig , or just in my office . 
i did a lot of research into devices that were usb only , even other ones that focusrite sold . 
the main reason i picked this one was its versatility in being both ipad and usb compatible.the complaints about the ipad connector cable are valid - it 's too stiff and short . 
i feel like i might accidently break it off if i 'm not too careful . 
why it uses a proprietary connector on the back of the unit , i 'll never know . 
to combat the included 30-pin cable i bought a $ 10 3ft 30-pin extension cable , which seems to do the job nicely . 
the garageband software on the ipad is simple enough to use , and while it can only record one of the 2 input channels at a time , that 's fine for what i expected . 
to record from a live sound-board , i just use the xlr input , set the gain -lrb- with the awesome colored halo ring -rrb- , and save the recording as a mono track.being small and solidly built , i 've got no problem tossing this in the milk-crate with the rest of my cables and peddles.in regards to how it records when plugging into a computer via usb -lrb- an imac in this case -rrb- , it 's even better than i expected . 
the garageband software on the mac does have the ability to record both input channels at the time time . 
the on-board monitor volume and headphone is fantastic . 
i thought it only would play back what was being input at that moment , but it does more than that . 
it 's a real monitor -lrb- the garageband software recognizes it 's the monitor output -rrb- , and when you have a multi-track recording that you 're working on , the software allows you to pass back other tracks from the computer while recording a new track.for example , i recorded a track with just the guitar -lrb- track 1 -rrb- , i was using the 1/4 '' input channel , and laid down that track . 
then i created a second guitar track and recorded a second guitar part -lrb- headphones plugged into itrack solo -rrb- and i was able to hear both the current track i was recording , and the first track . 
lastly , i plugged in a mic into the first input , and created a 3rd vocal only track . 
when i was singing , i was able to hear both guitar parts with the headphones still plugged into the itrack solo as well as my vocals recording in real-time . 
i was n't expecting this level of capability , and was very impressed by the lack of any noticeable latency in both the backing tracks and the vocals i was recording with all 3 going at the same time.the last thing i want to mention is the xlr pre-amp . 
focusrite has been making high-end professional recording equipment for a long time , and the thing they 're most well-known for is the mic pre-amp . 
i have to say , it is spectacular . 
there is absolutely no noise -lrb- no hiss , or clicks -rrb- of any kind . 
the gain staging nobs with the color halos make it so easy to setup , it 's almost too easy . 
the sound it captures is exactly what you expect , and you 'll notice right away if you 're using a low quality microphone . 
it definitely stands up to their reputation . 
having 48v phantom power to use those top dollar condenser mics is also a really nice thing to have . 
the demos on their website show how simple it is to use . 
once you start playing with it , you 'll realize it is a really nice tool for a solo artist , or someone who wants high portability , but great sound quality . 
get this . 
it was awesome ! 
blu-ray surround with the band was just amazing . 
great extras too . 
they were so much tighter on this concert than back in &#34; how the west was won &#34; the flashback x4 is an awesome sounding and flexible delay pedal . 
i got this through a third party seller on amazon for under $ 200 new ... a steal in my opinion . 
having three settings is awesome since i will use them all in a set . 
having the tap tempo is a must and this one works perfectly . 
the toneprints are cool to choose from if you find something you enjoy on the website . 
it 's simple to use my galaxy to &#34; beam &#34; the toneprint into the pedal from the pickups - very cool technology , makes me feel like i 'm on a guitar version of star trek . 
i ca n't say that i have a favorite delay type since they all sound so great . 
i am partial to the 2290 with modulation - very clean and very cool sounding without having too much chorus . 
the space setting is also very cool and has a hint of tremelo in the background , which coincides with the delay time - sounds great with a little overdrive added in.all in all , this is a great pedal and a purchase that i am totally happy with . 
it is by far the best delay pedal i have ever owned as well as being the most versatile . 
five stars from me !!! 
do n't know why quality instruments do n't come with bone nuts but these are a very inexpensive improvement . 
the next time you change your strings , check and see if your current nut is plastic . 
if so , have a few of these on hand and re -lsb- place that nut . 
you will hear the difference and they do n't wear out like plastic.just make certain you get the height correct so your action is n't too high . 
rule of thumb , grind just a bit at a time and keep checking for correct height . 
you can always remove more material but you ca n't put it back on ... this is a quick , easy improvement . 
i have bone on all of my guitars . 
i liked the string spacing on these nuts . 
you ~ could ~ just drop it in and play but you will soon realize it will need some refinement . 
my open b and e strings , with somewhat aggressive picking , would buzz like a sitar . 
this was corrected by filing the slots with a back angle towards the tuners . 
some additional filing will be needed to remove the sharp edges . 
the base of this bone nut does not have a radius . 
so if your nut slot is radiused , you will need to have it done or you will have poor sustain and possibly crack the nut in half at string tension . 
this is more common in vintage guitars , though.my guitar 's sustain was definitely improved with this nut . 
i highly recommend it ! 
i 've just replaced the original , plastic nut on my new squier strat guitar with this one.i had to file it down slightly to fit the slot and set the string height that i wanted but this was simple to do using a single flat metal nail file.i was shocked at how much ` brighter ' the guitar sounded with only this single change!even my wife who claims to have a tin ear , commented on how much clearer it now sounds.also , the shipping time warning was a bit over exaggerated . 
my piece arrived in a week -lrb- thank you very much ! -rrb- . 
for the low price , i think this will improve the sound of your guitar -lrb- safely -rrb- more than any other upgrade . 
far better than any light weight chrome stand , this has guts ! 
easily adjustible , knobs tighten easily and firmly . 
good height adjustment for sitting or standing . 
highly reccomend this stand ! 
this is a really nice music stand . 
i was n't expecting it to be such high quality . 
i wanted something better than those cheap metal music stands that would get knocked over by a small breeze of wind . 
definitely got what i wanted . 
the orange gearlux logo looks pretty cool too . 
buy it . 
i needed a new stand for my home studio so i thought i was cutting corners when i purchased this one . 
as it turns out , this stand is practically indistinguishable from mybelmonte orchestra stand deluxein construction and material quality . 
that stand sells for twice the price of this one at the time of this review.the stand is adjustable enough for sitting or standing musicians , and is stable enough to use outside . 
the rest/tray mechanism holds a lot of weight without losing any adjustments . 
in fact , i have attached analeratec universal tablet mountto hold an ipad with sufficient room left over for a 438 page copy of thethe new real book - volume 1and it holds those rock steady.another feature that i like is the legs can be configured like a tripod with varying angles , which is useful for outdoors with light breezes that would knock over lighter stands . 
or you can set the legs flush for maximum stability if space and the stand 's footprint are not problems.bottom line : this is a professional grade stand at a student stand price . 
i am thoroughly pleased with it and if ever i need another stand this is the model i will purchase . 
i love the snark tuners , and i own several different models . 
they all work great and of the various models , i prefer the sn-2 -lrb- red -rrb- . 
i got the white one because i just liked that it was a unique , amazon-only model . 
the sn-13 display is like the display on the sn-8 , and offers lower resolution than the sn-1 / sn-2 / sn-5 displays . 
still it works beautifully , and the glossy white looks nice clipped on my pearl white apx700 . 
its also easy to find should you drop it in the dark . 
well , without a tuner like this someone playing woodwinds might not even realize how a number of notes , usually in the lower octaves , are a little off . 
with cheaper made instruments like school instruments you would be surprised . 
this tuner helps you not only start in tune but also develop some strategies to deal with those sour notes . 
the fact that it works on guitars also just makes it worth the extra few dollars . 
highly recommended . 
and it looks great too . 
i 'll be honest here - i bought this one primarily because of its looks . 
not a lot of white clip-on tuners around . 
i also own an sn-8 and in comparing the two , the sn-13 seems to be as tight , but it 's only four stars because as another reviewer mentioned you can get the sn-8 -lrb- which has more features -rrb- for a few dollars less than what you 're paying for the sn-13 . 
still , it 's a typical snark . 
it registers very quickly , it 's easy to read , and you do n't have to pluck the string very hard at all for it to pick up the vibration . 
the stem on mine is a little looser than i would prefer but it still stays in position.my only real gripe is n't unique to this model but to all snarks . 
the curved stem combined with the round head means it wo n't sit very flat in a gig bag pocket and the stems are n't exactly robust , so i 'm always concerned that one day i 'm going to take it out of my bag and it will be in three pieces . 
other than that , i 'd recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive and pretty accurate tuner . 
i set this to free super saver shipping 5-8 days and it got here in three ! 
its very shiny looking and easy to see because there is a little thing where you can move to point the screen of it . 
although my friend told me there is a way you can see the chords you are playing do n't know how though . 
but all i bought it for was the purpose of tuning mission accomplished . 
5 stars for you ! 
this electric guitar padded bag is exactly what i wanted . 
the price was right , the guitar is secure and wont ' get scratched . 
the pockets are deep enough to hold whatever you need for a gig . 
very cost-effective . 
great price . 
strap is pretty crappy but picks are nice to have around . 
fairly good quality bag and the pockets are nice . 
good price . 
this does the job but it 's fairly thin and not all that well padded . 
for twice the price , you can get a really nice yamaha hard case that is way more than twice as good . 
the strap that came with it is no great shakes either . 
a great little package for the price , but unfortunately , the zipper failed the first time i tried zipping it up . 
i have a standard size acoustic guitar , but be aware , the fit was snug , but not tight . 
there 's no way to attach the shock mount to it -lrb- screws for securing it are n't provided , the holes dont match up , etc. . . 
oh well , i went with a standard microphone tripod behind my computer desk instead.i 'll come up with a use for this arm later otherwise i 'd have returned it.will not hold a blue yeti / yeti pro microphone . 
just an fyi these are nickel round wound strings which are on the bright side of the spectrum . 
designed to fit the general use guitarist they do the job . 
you do get a bit of finger noise moving along the string which is normal for this type of wind . 
being 10 's they are in the middle between the lighter strings which are easier to bend and the heavier strings which are where the tone is . 
i love the color coding on these which makes it easier to get the right string in the right hole unless of course you are color blind and there is no help for that . 
they are made in the usa which is bonus points and reason enough to buy them right there , put america to work . 
get to picking . 
i still had the original strings on an epiphone lp-100 guitar i bought last november . 
i know that 's bad , but buying strings can be complicated -lrb- and overwhelming -rrb- . 
it was nice to get these through vine and try them out.there is a definite difference in the sound of the guitar now that the new strings are on . 
it sounds cleaner and brighter.i wish i 'd changed the strings when i first started learning to play because these are much easier to play . 
now it 's not much of an issue , but it would have made a difference when i was breaking in my fingers those many months ago.i would definitely buy these again , especially because they are so inexpensive . 
i put these on a parker . 
great that they have uniform tension . 
took a bit to get used to , but they are very playable . 
vlues , rock , country . 
nice strings . 
this is the most awesome loop pedal ever !!! 
does the trick perfect , you can remove and add in elements to your loop ! 
super small , only potential drawback is that it can not be battery powered . 
small footprint , simple to use , one button , one knob and does not suck tone out of my guitar . 
it 's only got a basic feature set but that 's all i need . 
reasonable price too . 
highly recommended . 
wow ! 
if you want 5 minutes of no-nonsense , clean looping and overdubbing , ... the tc electronics ditto pedal will not disappoint ! 
i have been exploring the fringes and outer limits of guitar fx for over 30 years and this one has , in just two days , become one of my top five ` got ta have ' effects . 
it is so simple that a five year old could make great loops , and it add zero addition sound to your signal . 
placed at the end of your pedalboard , which is easy to do because of the ditto 's tiny footprint , the possibilities for live stunts and grooves is mind-blowing . 
and you ca n't beat the price . 
i 've uploaded a 5m workout that i recorded on my 2nd day using the ditto if you 'd like to hear it - a solo improvisation for telecaster and reverb . 
-lsb- ... -rsb- tc just does things right . 
i love how easy this is to use , the incredible clarity of sound , and 5 minutes of recording time . 
i do a single , duo , and full band . 
it goes with me to all gigs and i do use it for when i am practicing . 
highly recommended solution . 
what a great little gizmo ... i had a boss rc-3 looper , , , , , it involved too much bending over for me , , . 
and too hard to figure out ... , the ditto is so easy. , , , i take my trusty fender esquire ... a cord ... plug the chord in to a caitlinbread echorec pedal ... take a short cable from the output of the echo pedal to the input of the diitto pedal ... then connect output of the ditto to the amp ... set echo for multiple head repeats . . 
i like the setting between 7 and 8 on the program select knob , , , , then turn off the echo pedal ... get ready to play ... play the slow 4 chords to maggot brain ... eminor . . 
d. . . 
bminor ... c. ... count each chord as 123 456 . . 
as you come to start back on the eminor , , , , , press the ditto button one time with your foot , , , it will record you ... , . 
play in tempo ... ! . 
, ... its slow , , , , when you come back to the eminor , you want to press the ditto switch one time to stop recording right before the 1 count , , , its tricky. , to make it play back smooth without loosing part of a beat , , ... , . 
but easy with practice ... anyway , ... as soon as you press the ditto switch to end the recording , , , , it will automatically start playing it back. , , then , ... you turn on the echo pedal ... and proceed to jam on maggot brain. , , . 
, , till you achieve groovy-ness ... , you do n't want to record the rhythm part on to the ditto with the echo engaged , , , , that would make too much echo , , , , with both the playback and the part you play on top of it , both echo drenched , , , , no good , , , , , that would be way too echo crazy . . 
, it sounds much better and more effective with a dry loop track and a super wet echo second guitar part , , , have fun ... i 'm a raw and green beginner who is about the slowest learner ever.am 43 almost 44 and have been learning since 42 almost 43 . 
that being said using the looper was an eye opener . 
i bought it as a learning aide , to loop a progression and then try and run some pentatonics over the progression . 
the thing that opened my eyes is listening to the looped progression i played . 
there 's no denying your mistakes when you hear them while not playing . 
let 's just say i 'm not as close to being a player as i thought and i would &#34; not &#34; figured this out for quite some time if not for the looper . 
so it is an amazing critic for us beginners . 
and if your like me -lrb- and you experienced guitarist -rrb- you saw all the demos online and know what you as an experienced player can use it for . 
it 's an incredibly easy to use piece of equipment , after playing around with it for about 5or 10 mins you 'll have the gist of it . 
from what i understand it 's very basic compared to other loopers , i dont know anything about that but if your looking for just a simple to use looper this will definitely be to your satisfaction . 
this little simple looper sure is a ton of fun . 
beware that there is a learning curve to looping . 
with trial and error you can get your groove going seamlessly after a while . 
i 'm a little disappointed with the sound quality of the loop playback , could be better . 
i use this mainly with a double neck bass/guitar . 
compliments well . 
although im not onstage bouncing aroung ... they hold the strap on just fine ... no changing hardware like strap locks ... yes . . 
more colors so they would stay hidden would be nice ... but i will order more . . 
so i never had the luxury of the grolsch brand strap locks.i tried to raid the water bottles at the local cafe , but alas , i was too slow.it 's a bit hard to forge a strap lock out of a carlsberg bottle cap.so the fender ones will do just fine , plus they come in 2 colors and say fender.time to open another carlsberg , cheers fender . 
an amazing cheap solution but the dunlop strap pins are the best way to go overall but i defiantly trust these on my guitar . 
2 months and no problems yet very very loud electric guitar amp ! 
as a bass player , i was shocked that 40w could be that loud for guitar . 
i ca n't raise the volume above 1 in my house . 
when you switch it to acoustic or bass mode , the volume decreases dramatically , but it is a great amp for guitar players who also play bass occasionally.excellent top quality features . 
beautiful sound for each of the different modes . 
the acoustic setting really made my cheap electric guitar sound like it was an actual acoustic . 
the amp simulation is top notch.awesome value for the price!edit : i 've played through it more as a bass amp and after turning some dials and trying out the different settings ... i 'm even more impressed . 
one of the reasons the volume for bass was so much lower was that the default gain is at zero . 
i brought the pre and post gain up to a reasonable level and boom ... huge sound . 
i play with a 18 piece dance band and usually bring my hartke kickback for that group . 
after experimenting more , i would not hesitate to use the peavey for rehearsals and performances with that band.i still ca n't get over the fact that it is a 40w amp . 
the sound is enormous and clean for that much wattage . 
while the tascam us-322 audio interface appears to be a powerful tool for home based recording , it also appears that it is designed to work only in tandem with the included cubase le software . 
i am not a novice at home recording , as i have used many devices from 4 track cassettes to protools setups over the years . 
here is a rundown of my disappointing experience :1 -rrb- plugged into my ipad using the camera kit usb connector - got `` device not compatible with ipad '' message . 
too bad , but i can still use my art usb interface which works quite well with garageband .2 -rrb- installed driver on my old , g4 mac running 10.5.8 ; opened garageband , got `` no input '' message.could not evaluate the cubase software , as it requires mac os 10.6.8 . 
if i get a new computer , i will update my review . 
until then , i 'm disappointed . 
i love tascam gear , and have used it for nearly 30 years . 
i was excited to try out this interface and see what it could do . 
unfortunately , i was disappointed.while the construction and mechanical function of the device itself were good , the actual function with the computer left much to be desired . 
also , the complete lack of a manual with the one i got made it very difficult understand the functions . 
-lrb- sorry , but with a device this expensive and which includes 2 cds of software , how hard would it be to include a full manual on the install cd ? -rrb- 
there was a very small quick start guide included , which basically just named the various switches , inputs , and outputs , and gave extremely sparse directions about using the software mixer screen . 
i was forced into trial and error to see if i could get a serious recording in anything remotely resembling a multi-track mode . 
i could not . 
i could record and layer multiple tracks -lrb- i was using audacity , did n't want to install cubase -rrb- , but i could not get playback from the previous tracks while i also had live input . 
now this could have been my computer or audacity , as it is an older win xp machine , but it played back multiple tracks without problem.there was nothing in the mini-quickstart guide to address this , or even hint where one should look , other than going to tascam 's web site . 
i 'm sorry , but that is just not good enough with a device this expensive . 
there should be a complete manual , at least in pdf , included with the product . 
if i am going to use this to do serious recording , the last thing i want to do is waste huge amounts of time digging information out of a website , or worse , from `` user community '' threads in some blog.which brings me to another minor complaint - no linux drivers included . 
i use mostly linux , with only one windows machine for software which i ca n't get on linux . 
i wanted to try the software under wine on linux but was under time constraints.then there are the generic problems with software interfaces replacing hardware . 
with a hardware mixer , i can access as many controls as my fingers can handle -lrb- 3 or 4 on some mixers -rrb- at the same time . 
computerized mixers can only do 1 thing at a time , and one must be constantly moving the cursor from one thing to another to access controls . 
the controls on this interface were very fussy , and you have to position the cursor just exactly on a very small portion of a button to get it to react . 
i found it very tedious , and again , no actual instructions were included to help with that process . 
with a touch screen , it might be easier , but then why not just use buttons on a real mixer in that case ? 
-lrb- yeah , i know , touch screens are cool . -rrb- 
also , software based functions are always limited by your computer and os , and that means everyone can have a different experience - consistency is much harder to maintain.i am old school , and find hardware mixers far more responsive and useful . 
i know that lots of people are all excited about having software versions of hardware in their computers , and saving space , etc. , etc. . 
i value function over fashion , however , and that is what i have always liked about tascam gear : it was supremely functional . 
this software falls far short of what i expect from tascam , and the lack of a manual for the interface is inexcusable.good mixers , especially for multi-track recording , can be complex and difficult to learn . 
the layers of signal interconnection can be hard to understand at first , and takes some time to get comfortable with . 
old tascam manuals actually used to have a certain amount of instruction in multi-track recording , which was helpful to aspiring recording artists . 
not so here.i had really hoped to give this 3 or 4 stars , but sadly , it only rates a 2 -lrb- 2.5 if i could -rrb- for me . 
come on , tascam , you can do better than this . 
this unit is compact enough to take with you if you need a small interface to take along with your laptop for field recording . 
it is powered via the usb bus , so you do n't have to carry power supplies , or worry about finding an outlet for the device.one issue is that this is not a plug-and-play device . 
you will need to install a device driver in order for your computer to recognize it . 
after the driver was installed , i was able to get pro tools to recognize it right away without any issue . 
i recorded some tracks just to see how easy it was to work with and how it sounded . 
it works like any other interface in pro tools , so you will be able to use it easily enough . 
the mic pre-amps do n't seem terribly powerful and you will have to really up the input level to get anything out of a 48v condenser microphone like the ones i use to record vocals and guitars . 
i found that the overall sound quality was okay , but just okay . 
i would n't want to use this for anything important , but it will work fine if you are doing a field recording of rehearsals , or doing pre-production in a practice space . 
i would n't recommend it for serious studio work though and i would rather drag my pro tools i/o rack to a location if i was in the field.the build quality is a bit suspect on this as well . 
i noticed that the unit made a clinking noise when i picked it up after taking it out of the box . 
it seems that the bottom panel is not secure and is a bit loose . 
i can move the top and bottom together and apart , making a clinking sound . 
this can , of course , be taken care of very easily , but i would rather have a device come as it should . 
i have never had a problem with a tascam unit before and i have had a ton over the years , so i hope this is just a one-off quality control issue . 
the knobs feel okay , but there is a bit of play in the line out control and one of the attenuators is sticky.bottom line : 3/5 starsrecommended for casual use , but not for commercial use works perfectly . 
got the drivers for mac from the website and it instantly showed up in core-audio . 
very easy to use . 
love it ! 
very nice quality . 
i 've removed 1 star because of the 1/4 casing . 
the sheath likes to twist off a little too easily . 
i used plumbers thread tape and tightened it right up . 
other than that . 
i 've been using this cable regularly for a while and it works great . 
yep . 
it holds the strap on the neck of my guitar . 
i have a washburn rover , a backpacker style , and so a stap is a necessity , and this works just great . 
if you have to have a strap on your acoustic guitar , i would suggest this . 
i have a vintage 60s dixon hummingbird . 
i was really worried about scuffing it up . 
do n't worry with this . 
i wanted to put a strap on my acoustic guitar . 
now it is easier to handle , when trying to play . 
for some reason , when i saw &#34; 48 picks &#34; i think of a sandwich baggie full of plastic picks ... what i got was a slim resealable bag that 's about 1/8th the size i was thinking of . 
it comes with light , medium and heavy picks . 
even the light picks are thicker than the &#34; thin &#34; picks i had ordered before . 
i like having the variety though . 
this has a variety of colors as well as the thickness.the only thing that could have made this better is if it came with a drawstring on the bag so i could maybe hang it from my strap . 
i love this assortment . 
every color and size you 'll ever need . 
you can never have enough picks but this batch should keep you going for a while . 
this was an exceptional value and the picks are of nice quality . 
i would buy this again or recommend to anyone . 
i use medium picks so would search for a large batch of these in medium only though . 
definitely a 5 star purchase . 
great price for 12 picks spanning from light - heavy.picks are good quality and would recommend to anyone looking for picks . 
my classical guitar stand was metal and short , like this , but did not have the front brace or download slant . 
if i had this then my beloved flamenco guitar might not have tipped over and broken it 's headstock on the hard flood . 
so sad . 
i mourn it still . 
this is a great portable uke stand to have with you . 
it folds up small and will fit in the outside pocket on your uke gig bag . 
having this stand is a lot better than just laying your uke on the floor . 
my first review was a knee-jerk reaction to this amp as it had no manual with it . 
i could n't get it to sound like i wanted it to ... i was so wrong in giving it only 2 stars ... i must now rerate it with a 5 star . 
this amp does almost too much for the money . 
my only wish is that a manual came with it as you really need to spend some serious time playing with it to see the depth this thing has . 
it can do anything and sound any way you want it too.wow , i never knew my guitar could sound like this . 
it actually gives you any sound or personality you want it to have . 
i am beginning to love this thing and it will surely be my favorite amp when i totally figure it out , if i ever do . 
the sound production is endless as there are so many setting and different combinations of settings.so , in short , forgive me as i have sinned and judged too early . 
buy this thing but give yourself some time to familiarize yourself with it . 
if you are looking for a small , plug and play amp ... this is n't it . 
but it you 're looking for a powerful sound with endless possibilities . 
this is it . 
it is growing on me and i would n't part with it now . 
works very well and is portable . 
guitar leans pretty far back , but i ` put a sock on it ' , no literally , and now the guitar leans at the right angle . 
not literally a right angle , but a very good angle . 
why do you have to be so difficult ? 
i 've tried numerous stands for the variety of instruments i use : electric guitar , acoustic guitar , mandolin , violin , and banjo . 
this one fits all of them and holds them securely and folds up easily for transport . 
it does n't get in the way , has rubber feet and padding , and just works simply and effectively . 
it 's not flashy looking , but then it 's never seen because it either is hidden by the instrument , or blends in because of its compact size and black color . 
nothing else is as versatile and effective , including the multi instrument stands , the ones with other shapes of the support arms , and other folding designs . 
this is simply the ideal . 
the concept of this guitar stand is great , and i thought it would be perfect for my two telecasters ... that is until i get the stands in place and put the guitars in them . 
the stands have a very deep angle , and from what i could tell , the guitars were sitting about 40 to 45 degrees back.it just looks silly , like your guitars are trying to slip out of the stand , or are in a slow-motion fall backwards . 
it also ends up taking up way too much space , as the stand has to be set out from the wall or corner quite a bit for clearance purposes . 
i ended up returning these stands , but would definitely buy again if they produced a more upright version . 
i like the fact is foldable and can be put away or carried easily . 
the biggest down side is the angle that the guitar sits , the lean is to far back so you 'll need to keep it further from walls than usual . 
other wise good deal . 
i needed an inexpensive music stand for my guitar lessons . 
this worked well for that . 
the stand works great . 
it supports my casio ctk6250 on the shortest level and can go pretty high as well . 
this thing folds up so it is easy for storing . 
it is a bit heavy , but that allows it to support almost any keyboard . 
this is by far the most stable keyboard stand out there and a great price too . 
just what i was looking for ! 
the same as the old one i got in my bc rich warlock netck tru great little piece of leather . 
does what i want it to do and does not hurt my guitar . 
thank you i received this yesterday in my order . 
it fits on my guitar fine , but i ca n't seem to get my guitar strap affixed to the head stock strap . 
the button is so rounded and smooth , that my guitar strap just wo n't go over the top of the button . 
not sure what to do now . 
this is an attractive leather head stock strap . 
the leather is very soft and flexible . 
i would love to have an entire guitar strap made from the same leather . 
fit perfect to my taylor t5 and no cons i can find so far . 
if you want a capo for guitar , this one is the one stop shopping for you . 
these headphones really seem to be built pretty well , so it is with some regret that i have to report that i do n't like them.the sound reproduction is not flat , and it has a distinct bass heaviness that i ca n't use when recording or mixing . 
in addition to the bass-heavy delivery , there seems to be a dip in the upper mids , a boost in the low mids , and a rolling off of the high end . 
this just does n't work for me in the studio . 
the overall size of the headphones is large and they wo n't fit well for people with smaller heads . 
i had some people try them on and they all stated that the earpieces went down too far and did n't fit on their ears properly . 
i checked to make sure that they were retracted to their smallest size and they were.this is a shame , as tascam make some fine products and are a good name . 
i have owned four da-88 recorders , many field recorders , and three different portable recorders from them , all of which have been great . 
i am certainly not saying anything bad about the company , but their headphones are just put out there to be low-priced headphones that are not suited to a professional studio.i have used thesony mdr7506 professional large diaphragm headphone -lsb- electronics -rsb- for decades now and i still recommend them . 
i have had the same pairs for over 20 years and they are all still going strong , barring replacing the ear padding . 
the sony headphones do not cost a tremendous amount more , and they are worth every penny if you are doing studio work.i would also recommend theakg k 240 mk ii stereo studio headphonesorakg k 240 semi-open studio headphonesover the tascam reviewed here . 
the akg perform much better when you are using a headphone amplifier though , so that would need to be taken into account . 
i personally went with the pitch black pedal tuner . 
the reason why is the led lights on these guys are small and harder to see onstage . 
the pitch black is nice and bold and bright . 
one reason why i almost got this thought is the ability to tune all strings at the same time . 
so its a give and take issue . 
this thing is amazing . 
love the sound it produces.well made , like a tank . 
real quality.expect to be using this without any problems for a long long time . 
these really do work well , but it is a difficult struggle to get them separated at 1st . 
they stick together too well and it is hard to separate them at 1st without ripping the individual pads . 
i found it a little easier putting them in the fridge over night , then slowly pulling them apart . 
i also thought about heating them a little or perhaps adding a few drops of water . 
however chilling them did work well enough . 
that aside , these will greatly improve the way any set sounds . 
i 've been a pro drummer for over 45 years , and have used masking tape , little cloth squares tapped down , lots of different things . 
there work best by far and are easily moved around depending on the room you are in and the sound you want . 
great stuff . 
oh and check out a drum dial to add to your tuning skills . 
that can help and a great drum does n't sound so good if it is n't tuned right . 
this thing is tiny and does not have the breakable swivel head of the original snark . 
this is the only tuner you need ! 
always looking for that elusive perfect capo , light yet strong and dependably firm?you just found it.this is an exemplary capo . 
no surprise , as it 's designed by ned steinberger , who understands what it means to strip a guitar down to the basics . 
it 's made of serious aluminum and the spring is super-solid . 
the tighten feature means you can put it on your guitar and then tighten it so well that it wo n't come off again until you loosen it . 
no slippage here ! 
this also lets you move the capo further behind the fret so it 's even less in the way of your hand , a very useful feature which most other one-hand capos ca n't offer.it 's an easy on-in-seconds design that is as slim and simple as it gets . 
the rubber is well-bonded and looks unlikely to pull off for years at least , unlike many cheap capos . 
it sits well on any six-string , though is not flat enough for a classical . 
but most of us use capos mainly for acoustic and maybe a bit of electric -lrb- unless you 're albert collins , who always used one and would have loved the tightening aspect here -rrb- , so this will cover all your basic capo needs.it 's got a little slot for the d'addario brand tuner , but i use a snark and these two go together well ; put on the capo , activate the tuner on the headstock , tune it up , and away you go , perfectly in tune in seconds while using a capo ! 
if you 've ever suffered onstage while switching frets with a capo , this is a godsend combo . 
the capo also has a little pick slot , which will comfortably take up to about a .73 mm pick . 
it fits .60 picks perfectly , by the way.this ns artist capo is well worth 20-25 bucks , and since i got it my shubb and kysers have sat lonely in the corner.if you have n't ever experimented with capos , try them out . 
they can really change the way you play your guitar , and may help you find you sing better than you think , as we all have our best keys , and a capo can help you find yours . 
i love playing bluegrass licks in g while capoed at the second fret , for instance . 
the extra zing and crisper tone make me play different licks and it 's almost like another instrument . 
this goes for every fret , pretty much , up to about the sixth , where it gets a little cramped.all in all , this is the best capo i 've ever used , especially for this quality at this price . 
the capo is pretty good . 
i like the ability to customize tension . 
however , it is unclear which way the capo should be put on - with the &#34; pincer &#34; side facing the floor , or facing the ceiling ? 
in either direction , it 's a bit awkward to put on/take off , as the angle of the pincer is difficult to get right quickly . 
the kaiser is still the best , imo , but you ca n't adjust the tension on those . 
overall , this is good but not great . 
planet waves ns artist capo is as near perfect a capo that i 've ever come across . 
i 've been a kyser capo gal for many , many years but , this capo has that one beat by a mile . 
there was absolutely new fret buzz no matter which of my guitars i tried it on or which fret i placed it on . 
as i strummed each string to sound was so clear . 
it 's also very easy to open with one hand and keep it open , without any stress to your hand , until you release your grip to clamp it into place.i do believe the folks at planet waves have developed the best capo ever ! 
and the price ai n't so bad either . 
4.6 starsmy main concern with adapters like this is sound quality . 
the a/d is often weak , and there is sometimes too much latency for it to be useful for multi-tracking . 
apogee covers both areas well with this little puppy ; the a/d is quite smooth , and it transfers the signal near perfectly . 
and little it is , not much bigger than the jack . 
if bon scott only knew ... but small though it may be , there 's plenty of signal processing power in there , and while it does n't stand up my best outboard gear , it offers very clean , clear sound transfers from guitar , bass , keys and line mics , so that you can do good-sounding entire tunes on your laptop with only the jam as interface . 
which is yet another step forward in high-quality home recordings . 
i like the thought that we 're getting closer to folks releasing things entirely by themselves on their own sites , and not paying crapple a huge chunk of profits for merely hosting a file . 
record companies and file hosts are increasingly anachronistic due to tech like this jam , and maybe soon enough we 'll see artists keeping all of the profits from their art . 
imagine that!this offers very close to studio quality , but keep in mind that even with 24-bit it is solid state . 
once you 've used a good tube preamp you know what a difference in warmth in can make . 
i ran this through one of mine and the a/b made it very obvious that old school studio gear still has its place.speaking of crapple , the ads for this suggest that it is for istuff only , which is not true . 
i ran it on 7 ultimate and it worked a charm , so do n't be fooled by the typically proprietary ads , which cook and co. probably insist on : &#34; do n't mention anybody but us ! 
offer no alternatives ! 
they must stay in our universe ! 
&#34; well , you need n't , this works with almost anything , so do n't be fooled by the ad copy.the only negative i can find is that it is a little chintzy in outer build , making one wonder how good the internals are , and how long they 'll hold up . 
a stronger , more solid sleeve would have been nice , especially at the price of 130 . 
but it does sound good , though as it may be used for portable purposes , you might want to wrap it for transport in a little hand towel or such to make sure shocks do n't mess with it . 
take care of your recording equipment and it will take care of your music ! 
likes : - pretty smooth . 
minimal fret noise and squeak compared to some - bright , strong mids . 
- they do seem to stay in tune well . 
havent had to change tuning once they settled in.will update this review with more experience as i play on these strings over the next week . 
i am , primarily , an acoustic guitar player who acquired my first electric just about a year ago , a gibson les paul . 
what i am finding is that the situation with electric guitar strings is very similar to that with acoustic guitars . 
most name-brand strings are just fine , but some are markedly different than others . 
a few are actually a notch-above the others . 
these nyxls from d'addario are definitely in that ` notch above ' category.i find them easier to play , better sounding and more reliable in holding their tuning than the six or seven others i have tried . 
i plan to stick with them . 
a few comments about each area : playability : these nyxls bend easier and take less of a toll on the tips of my fretting -lrb- left -rrb- hand than do most of the others . 
of course i have callouses that have been developed over the years and feel permanent - but heavy playing can still make my fingertips sore . 
these strings seem less ` cutting ' , even after a couple of hours of constant playing . 
they also ` squeak ' less when i slide up and down the neck.sound : the sound is crisp and rich at the same time . 
most electric guitarists who i know tend to prefer one of these qualities over the other and choose their strings accordingly . 
i prefer a blend of both - just as i do for my acoustic instruments . 
these nyxls provide the closest blend that i have been able to achieve of these two different but complimentary characteristics , andtuning : tuning and re-tuning can drive a guitar player to distraction . 
even some really good sounding strings do n't hold the tuning very well and even after only one brief riff , need to be adjusted by at least a quarter tone . 
these nyxls are holding the tuning far better than the others i have used . 
less time tuning = more good time playing!all - in-all , i found no flaw in these strings . 
there is always something new coming along and d'addario 's formulation that uses high carbon steel alloy in the manufacture of these strings seems to make a considerable and positive difference . 
until someone comes up with something better , i expect to stick with them ! 
i 've been using ernie balls cobalt slinky light gauge because i like the feel . 
i got these from the vine , and wow , they are awesome . 
they cost no more than the strings i normally get , but the tone and feel is totally different . 
i ca n't comment on how long they 'll last or keep in tune . . 
but for now , i 'm impressed . 
i 'll probably keep using these on my santana prs for awhile since i like the sound . 
every once in awhile , i 'll step outside of my box ... i mean . . 
i know the strings that i like and i tend to stick with them . 
i use d'addario on my acoustic guitars , and ernie balls on my electrics . . 
accept for my strat . . 
i like fender bullets on it . 
so the sample from the vine ... sorta of nudged me . . 
and i 'm the better for it . 
my father is a full-time gigging musician primarily on steel guitar and telecaster . 
he has been playing over 50 years and it takes a lot to get him interested in new strings . 
we both use d'addario strings almost exclusively -lrb- myself on bass guitar , and him on the electric -rrb- . 
these are * outstanding * strings with great durability , playability and exceptional sound . 
they remain in tune for long gigs or recording sessions , they generate less fret noise than comparable strings and have a bright/crisp sound that really stands out . 
well worth the extra investment . 
highly recommended ! 
d'addario has always been one of the best string manufacturers around . 
i 've used their strings for electric & acoustic bass , electric and acoustic guitar , irish bazouki , mandolin , irish tenor banjo , 5 string banjo & even used their octave mandolin strings on my serbian brach always with stellar results . 
when they said these were deluxe premium strings i knew it would n't be hype . 
i was right . 
i strung my guitar with these about 3 weeks ago & have probably played the guitar 25 or so hours at gigs and in the studio . 
i 've never had a set of strings stay in tune over the course of 3 - 45 minute sets but these did . 
and i was sober so it was n't just an altered consciousness that made me believe they were still in tune . 
not only that they were still completely in tune the next morning when i played it . 
of course that would n't mean a thing if they did n't feel good on the fingers . 
they do . 
like they were custom made for your guitar . 
they were on my rickenbacker so i ca n't honestly tell you if they work good with a vibrato but i strongly suspect they would . 
not only do they stay in tune but 3 weeks later they still sound crisp & new . 
i 'm going to be interest to see how long they continue to sound good . 
i usually change my strings every other week when i 'm playing regularly so i 'm already passed my regular limit . 
i may update this review in a month or so when i know how long they lasted . 
most highly recommended ! 
i usually use gibson vintage nickle strings on my electric guitars but when i had an opportunity to try theses strings out i jumped at the chance . 
i put them on a gibson les paul goldtop guitar with p-90 pickups . 
i had no trouble installing them and they tuned up pretty quickly without a lot of stretching needed . 
they had some great &#34; spank &#34; and sounded great . 
easy to play -lrb- they almost seemed thinner than advertised - they play like 9 's but sounded like tens -rrb- . 
i am really happy with these and will probably buy them on occasion instead of the gibson strings . 
next i want to try a set on a strat and see how they sound - i suspect they will sound and play great ! 
excellent tone , and i 'm a bit surprised by that . 
i mean , d'addario strings are fine and all , but that 's it , they 've always just been your average basic string to me . 
these promise to be a premium contender and they certainly deliver . 
i strung up my agile al-3000 -lrb- best les paul copy you can buy , look them up -rrb- with them , tuned up and these things roared ! 
rich full harmonic tone , with plenty of bend and sustain . 
these strings really do feel and sound great . 
i never thought i 'd be praising d'addario so much , but these strings really do deliver . 
just put these on my martin dcx1e and they sound great ! 
this is a big guitar that really rings out and the elixir strings have a great sparkle with a clear bright tone . 
playing rhythm guitar , flat picking and fingerpicking.i ca n't say if they last longer , vine has us review this asap . 
after daily playing for hours they sound fine and hold their tuning . 
i have used elixir nano web strings before and i do think they keep their tone a bit longer . 
that being said , my go to strings are still d'addario . 
i ordered this for my husband , the musician . 
he said these are high quality strings giving great tone and good feel . 
he would definitely purchase this product ... and he 's pretty picky about his guitar strings ! 
i had the opportunity to try a set of elixir nanoweb light gauge -lrb- .013 - .053 -rrb- strings in both phosphor bronze and 80/20 bronze . 
instead of writing a separate review for each , i figured i &#8217; d write one review for both types of strings and post it in both places for those who are trying to figure out which strings would best meet their needs.the phosphor bronze strings are mounted on a brand new guild f-47 rc guitar . 
it is a concert sized guitar with a florentine cutaway . 
the body is brazilian rosewood and the top is adirondack -lrb- red -rrb- spruce . 
i have always heard that phosphor is a bit brighter and sounds better on a rosewood guitar . 
i would agree . 
the tone is nicely balanced &#8211; maybe a bit weak in the bass , but the strings are new and in a couple days i expect them to sound a bit better . 
the notes are articulated well , and there is a nice midrange tone.the nanoweb coating is nice . 
it protects the strings from corrosion -lrb- finger sweat really can do a job on strings -rrb- without dulling the sound . 
i think the guitar sounds much better than it did with the original -lrb- guild -rrb- strings , and it just plays easier.the 80/20 strings are mounted on a gibson hummingbird &#8211; an iconic mahogany body/spruce-topped dreadnaught sized guitar . 
again , 80/20s are recommended for mahogany guitars . 
as popular as the hummingbird is , i was never totally pleased with the sound of it . 
it is a great guitar to strum along with while singing , but it almost sounded too muddied &#8211; not enough articulation between the different strings . 
the elixir strings really bring out something extra from the gibson . 
it sounds a lot better and feels easier to play . 
the strings are easier to play &#8211; partially because of the coating &#8211; partially because the metal used in the string seems to have a bit more elasticity &#8211; without going out of tune.the bass is tighter and there is an even spread of tone from the lowest to the highest notes . 
i am very happy with how much better this guitar sounds with these strings compared to the martin sps that were on it prior to the switch.elixirs are not the cheapest strings out there , but since they last a lot longer than cheaper strings , in the end you won &#8217; t spend more money on what i think are far superior strings . 
i have tried coated strings in the past -lrb- including elixirs -rrb- and have never been very fond of them . 
whenever i tried them i felt a certain disconnect from my guitar . 
somewhat reminiscent of wearing condom . 
not that i hated them , just did n't really love them . 
these are the best ones i 've tried so far . 
i still do n't like them as much as regular strings but because of the type of gigs i mostly do these seem to be a reasonable trade off . 
if you need a longer lasting string for whatever the reason these are really the best out there . 
after a dozen or so gigs with them , they still sound the same as when i put them on . 
well , made by elixir and developed with taylor guitars ... these strings were designed for the new 800 -lrb- rosewood -rrb- series guitars that came out this year -lrb- 2014 -rrb- ... the promise is a &#34; bolder high end , fuller low end &#34; ... i am a long-time taylor owner and favor their 800 series -lrb- rosewood/spruce is my favorite combo in tone woods -rrb- ... i have almost always used elixir nanoweb phosphor bronze lights on my guitars ... i like not only the tone but the feel and longevity of these strings ... i have never had any issues with elixir nanowebs ... i recently picked up an 812ce first edition 12-fret ... such a fine instrument and it came with the elixir hd 's ... took some getting used to as far as feel -lrb- due to the slightly higher gauges of the treble strings - e , b & g -rrb- ... but as far as sound , they are great ... the d , a & low e strings are no different from the regular elixir pb lights so i am not sure about the claim of &#34; fuller low end &#34; ... compared to what ? 
unless the extra string tension of the treble strings also contributes to a little more bass response ... i am not sure how these strings will perform on guitars other than taylor 's but what anyone should notice is more volume and clarity from the treble strings ... that is what i notice most from the hd 's compared to the regular ... i still find no fault with the regular elixir nanaweb pb 's but will most likely continue to run the hd 's on my 12-fret ... i may also try them on my older 814ce just to see if there is any difference/improvement ... so far i find the set well balanced with good clarity and sustain ... try them out and make your own decision ...
